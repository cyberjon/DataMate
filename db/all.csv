My people have been in that area since about 1870, when my great grandfather immigrated from Croatia(Yugoslavia or ""Austrian Empire"" as stated in his census records!) and settled 1st in the Rockport area. Frandolig Point Park is named after my great grandmother's family. My father owned and operated a place on the waterfront called Woody's Boat Basin, now called Woody's SportsCenter. I grew up on the docks and running around barefoot on oyster shells . I'm the youngest of seven and my closest sibling is 10 years my elder and my eldest sibling was 24 years old when I was born. All but my two youngest sisters have passed, as have both of my parents. Dad died at 95 and mom at 84, so I was blessed to have them both for a long time. I miss them, but I really can't complain. They both passed peacefully and my mother passed in our hundred-year-old home just across the street from where she was born in Port Aransas. You may not be surprised to know that yes, I was spoiled! We were not wealthy, but very comfortable.Much of my life was spent in the Scouting program. I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, traveled America and the world with Scouting, and founded both a Cub Scout Pack and a Boy Scout Troop here in Leander. And No I am NOT happy about openly gay people being allowed to join, but ecstatic about girls finally being given the opportunities given to boys for almost 110 years. Girl Scouts has no clue about what is RIGHT! I have three daughters and one son that range from 14 years old to 23. My oldest daughter attended Abilene Christian University on a choir scholarship and graduated 12/17 and just started her 1st job as the asst. choir director at a high school NW of Houston! YAY!!! Maybe a country singing artist someday! WOO HOO! SHE IS AWESOME! My 21 year old son finished his freshman year at Texas A&M University pursuing a degree in chemical engineering and quite frankly he, let's just say, didn't have his ducks in a row. Still there, but attending Blinn until Aggieland likes him again, and is currently practicing being an adult and paying his own rent and most of his bills!!! My 20 year-old daughter is my newest Aggie and is pursuing a degree in agri-economics and was just accepted as an Aggie Blossom!! The baby is a big 8th grader and plays all 5 sports at school...Vball, bball, cross country, track, and soccer, in addition to playing club volleyball for the Austin Juniors and playing rec softball. Both of my younger daughters played very competitive level softball and are both still in Girl Scouts. The older of the two travelled to France, Italy, and England with Girl Scouts and her mom this summer. As a family, we all hunt and fish. All of my kids have taken deer at our now sold family ranch near Medina, Texas. My 20 year old just took a beautiful 8 point buck 12/17. Sorry if you think that's cruel, but when push comes to shove, we will survive while you crunch on KEENwahhh!(Love me some quinoa btw!) I currently live in an old stone ranch house which I lease on 240 acres on the edge of town with Starbucks about five minutes away. My ex and I are friendly and we have joint custody, although her home is their primary residence about 5 miles away. They come when they want to come or when I want them to come. We don't fight over the kids at all. I have a beautiful yellow Labrador retriever named Nala. She's my buddy, my watchdog, and my hunting companion. I recently rescued a little turdbird Chihuahua named Bo (BoBo!) from a a friend whose circumstances changed and he is basically Nala's new buddy and chew toy!I'm a diehard Astros-WORLD CHAMPS 2017....YAY!, Cowboys, and Spurs fan and at least one is ROCKIN' IT and last I checked, none of them are showing their asses by disrespecting Old Glory, America, or most important of all, our amazing Veterans, which includes all three of my brothers and my AMAZING mom! Yes, Momma wore Army boots in WWII as a WAC! Love me some Dak & Zeke, but I refuse to support the NFL until they get their kneeling BS straightened out! GO SPURS GO, but keep your liberal political mouth shut Popovic!Musically, I am an old trumpet player and all but my oldest are trumpeters also.

Ha! I am a great cook and yes, homemaker and for the 1st time in years I had a garden with tomatoes and peppers and about 14 different herbs. No, not the smokin' kind! Is there anything mobetta than a homegrown tomater????. I drink Coke and never Pepsi and I'm also a Pepper and drive FORDS! Since 1998, I have owned and operated Bathtub Refinishers of Texas. Mostly, I repair construction damaged bathtubs in new multifamily construction projects. Not particularly glamorous but it pays most of my bills!

And, while staying within the confines of the present, unconditionally bestowing upon her the faith, trust, and commitment, expressively and demonstratively.- Believing that no one is perfect, and thus accepting and embracing my partner as she is.- Avoiding to force alter the value systems that might have gotten ingrained over time in my partner's personality.- Respecting my partner as a free and independent thinker, thereby allowing her a non-intruding comfort zone to move about and breath in.- Believing and understanding that like me, my partner also emotionally and physically needs, desires, and craves caressing, pampering, fondling, cuddling, flirting, exploring, and everything that is sugar and spice.- Being unabashedly expressive of my feelings and affections for and towards my partner, while at the same time generously reciprocating her moves, needs, wishes, and desires.- Besides ever staying positively responsive, taking lead in initiating moves to seek and secure my partner's attention, closeness, and favors.- Having said the above, a similar explicit and demonstrative belief system and understanding on the part my sweet partner is desired and expected, failing which any relationship is bound to collapse as being incomplete, one sided, and undesirable.A FEW MAJOR ROADBLOCKS IN THE WAY TO ANY RELATIONSHIP- Lack of respect for each other.- Lack of mutual responsibility.- Temptations and expectations stemming from scamming dispositions.- Seeking some sort of sugar daddy / sugar mama relationship.

Not into astrology, but for those who it might make a difference -- POF got it wrong -- I'm not a Virgo, born on the cusp in September, which puts me on the Libra side (Phew! Glad that's out there).Current interests include family, a little hobby ranching (few acres) and casual jogging, etc. I do like to travel – international and/or RVing. Did most of my international traveling while on business and when in the Navy. About ready to explore the places I missed in a more leisurely fashion. A 40' RV with all the amenities let's me travel in comfort and includes a tow-Jeep for exploring/4-wheeling and a fishing pole for relaxing. Try to get out on the road for a month or 2 in the summer -- beach, the Rockies and places in between. Snorkeling/ deep-sea fishing in Costa Rica isn't that bad either.You can see somewhat of my life's history in the attached photos, as well as where some of my interests are/were. Kind of like having to watch your uncle's home slide show (Do they still have slides?). Guess I'm not going to be doing dinner with any PETA members with these pix. Hate to say it, but not much on house pets, either ... achooo! Do have a couple of Border Collies. I love them and they love to run -- outdoors.Quiet dinner, old cafes, UT football, occasional night at the theater, just kicking around – all in the realm of my likes. Enjoy trying things I’ve never done. Open-minded, not hard over on ""always"" having my way and willing to try almost anything – at least once.Always heard opposites attract and that was probably true a few years back (married a couple of 'em), but my current thinking, for a good match, is someone with similar likes/dislikes.",Non-Smoker with Thin body type," Austin, Texas ","75 year old Male, 5' 8"" (173cm), Christian - other",Caucasian,cdrusn is looking for a relationship.,Masters Degree,Adventurer,Entrepreneur,Woman,Long Term,Viewhis relationship needs,View his chemistry results,Socially,Does not want children,Divorced,No,Mixed Color,Hazel,Yes,All my kids are over 18,Over 10 years,Ambitious,Dog,,75,M,Virgo

I may look like a thug, but I've got a Masters Degree and can hold an intelligent conversation. I live by myself, I own my home, I'm confident, funny, attractive, somewhat normal (or at least not abby-normal), easy to talk to, and a really good kisser. :-) I've been told that I look like Brad Pitt,...from a distance, at night, with the appropriate set of beer-goggles on. I don't lie, cheat, or steal, and I have a big heart. Sort of a tattooed teddy bear. :-)What am I looking for?I would like to find a normal, attractive, sweet girl, with a good sense of humor. If your profile reads like this; High maintenance, bad tempered, bipolar, psychotic, who smokes like a chimney, has most of her own teeth and killed her ex with a meat fork, is looking for a red-neck lover to share her double-wide, then we probably won’t be a good match. Also, I really appreciate honesty. Example; I talked to one girl whose profile said “non-smoker”, but on the phone she sounded like a sea pirate, so it was pretty clear that she wasn’t a stranger to the Marlboro man. I’m not really specific on looks. I think many things can make a woman attractive and/or sexy and beauty is both internal and external. But if you’re 20 years older than your pics, have 3 teeth (even if they’re 3 good teeth), a glass eye, or if your friends refer to you as “sasquatch” because of excessive body hair, we probably wouldn’t be a good match.If we meet, I can pretty much guarantee that you will be intrigued, amused, or at the very least, not bored. :-) One other note. I'm not a biker in the sense that I'm into a specific lifestyle. I'm a program manager working for a computer company. I have a Harley, a bass boat, and lots of other toys. But they are just hobbies.I'm also a romantic. I remember my parents holding hands and looking into each other's eyes and you knew they loved each other.

If you see me wearing something other than shorts from mid February to mid November, something is seriously wrong (weather permitting). I like golf and my mountain bike -- in that order. I follow college football and golf the most, but I like NFL and college basketball also. I like to ride the hike and bike trail fives times a week. I would like to do more camping, and love going to Big Bend National Park. I love to eat and like to cook. I am not into trendy bars and clubs that will be closing 18 months from now - to only be replaced by another trendy bar that will be opening down the street - that will be closing 36 months from now. Bottle service? Really? What a joke! I am not into tattoos, Las Vegas, pit bulls, rap music, or smoking. If you are into those things, we are not a fit. It's not that I am close-minded. Many of my friends have tattoos. It's just where I draw the line. Actually, I have VERY broad interests. I don't know how to explain it, but some people love seafood, some people hate seafood. Some people hate seafood because of the way it tastes; some won't eat seafood because they are committed vegans - for any number of reasons. Vegas has zero charm. It has very little soul. Yes, you can see a great show and have a great meal, but I just can't get past the fake Venice canals and the phony NYC ""skyline"". Vegas started losing the cool factor just after the Rat Pack packed it in. If I choose to visit a city - give me a ""real"" city - NYC, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston. I would rather do a 'staycation' in Austin, than go to Vegas. I am the guy that has to stop at all those historical markers on the way to Lubbock. I like doing the NY Times crossword puzzle. Sorry, but I am not a vegan; I am a fifth-generation Texan and there is just too much culture that would have to be thrown out the window if I went strictly vegan. Politics?

I was born in Texas and the World was my playground as a Son of a Solider It has been said that a man that finds a wife finds a good thing. Well the Judge told me that there was a recall on the two I married, LOL. I like to believe; I am a Southern Gentleman, and that every Lady should be treated in the same matter a Man treats his Mother .But please do not think I soft, as I am not. I believe the best part of any relations is conversation. As Lao Tzu teaches that if a Speaker speak from the Heart to the one who is listen the is no misunderstanding. As a man of many years, I have made more than my share of mistakes. I like to believe I have learned from them and the Mistakes of others. I enjoy walks in the parks, cooking at home, movies, plays, concerts, long rides on my Bicycle with friend or just my mp3. I judge no one and do not allow others to judge me. I do not live my Life by the standards of society, as this is measured in greed.I am a man who lives his life by a Code which has been hand down from Master to student for 1000s year, The Code of Bushido). Some people believe that my Politeness’ is a sight of weakness. As a former Solider: I know when it is time to fight. Therefore, I pick my battles, but do not get it twisted The Samurai believed that being Polite was handing the Head of their Enemy back to them after they have cut it off, and I can and will. The question is will I be polite. As for playing Games, like many people in this enjoy doing, these days. I to enjoy to play games but that is what my Granddaughter is for. If you try to bring games into my life, then your feeling will get injured.

And here's what I learned: Women choose men, not the other way around.And when I thought about the women in my life I realized something... they chose me! (I thought it was the other way around!)If the men in your life think they chose you, they're wrong....You allowed them to woo you.Would like to find someone willing to go to the Broken Spoke for dance lessons with me. C&W.So I am going to tell you about me and then you can decide if you want to choose me. Fair enough?I was born in Chicago and sometimes you can hear it when I talk. I grew up in Deerfield, IL and in high school I was more interested in sports and girls than studying - but I'm not at all stupid! I did go to college but it was during the Vietnam war and the influence of the hippie trippy movement. so I didn't graduate. I'm amazed that anyone graduated during that turbulent time.Although I play hockey (team captain) and am a Chicago Bears fan, I have another side. I like plays and musicals. I go to see plays at Way Off Broadway, The Hill Country Theater and The Georgetown Palace whenever I can. I love good conversation on just about anything. So although I don't have a degree, I will probably surprise you with how much I know.Do you love to laugh? A sense of humor is so important. I love to laugh and really want to be with someone who is witty and likes to laugh too.Enjoy spontaneous meetings so it would be nice if we lived fairly close.Like dining out, movies, exploring surrounding towns and dancing if chemistry works. I'm actually a really good dancer, but it's weird - I can't dance well with everyone...there has to be that special something.Dirty martinis are a special love of mine. I'm not an alcoholic by any means but I do love them. I'm thinking that heaven is an awesome bar and a bartender who makes the absolute best martinis!!Religion - Please be open minded. I had a first date with a women who actually got up and abruptly left because she determined I didn't believe in God in the same way she did. I am always learning and love conversations about religion and spirituality. I do not regularly attend church.Family - I have an unbelievable granddaughter who is 7yrs old. She lives with my son and daughter in law in the Dallas area. My other son lives in Denver and is living the dream. He has a great job, a woman he loves and does about anything he wants; hiking, skiing, camping, you name it. I have a sister in Round Rock and another in Chicago.I am a movie lover. In fact, I have a hard time finding a movie I haven't seen on Netflix. So yeah, I do sit on the couch and watch TV. So sue me. But if you have something more interesting....I'm all yours.TV shows I watch are Ancient Aliens, Homestead Rescue, Expedition Unknown.Best movies - As Good As It Gets, Ghost TownSo again, you make the choice.

Ya gotta send an email.Search youtube; Zevon Letterman Mutineer; Kat Edmonson Lucky; Fleetwood Mac Rhiannon Live 1976 Stevie Nicks; Lone Justice, Wheels; or Richie Havens Just Like A Woman 30th Anniversary Concert. If you live or understand the passion within these performances, contact me immediately.....How did people our age end up with this (online services?) as the way to meet each other? Whatever happened to party lines, or crank calls, or the odd, flirtatious glance across the room? Or the random pause in the local grocer? A trail? Without our headphone? Do you remember actual interaction? We could always find each other in the most unusual places. Anyway, it's 2019, its modern, so here goes..First and foremost, I'm a man not a boy. Like Kevin Costner said in 'Bull Durham' ""After 20 years in the minors, I don't try out."" You know what you’re going to get with a man like me. With that being said, if you're looking for a boy - girl relationship, pass me by. However, if you’re a woman, along with all that term can imply, and you're tired of being in a youthful relationship, feel free to contact me. I listen, learn, love, feel and enjoy all that life can give, and would expect the same from a like-minded partner. I'm easy to please, low maintenance, (though I can still be quite playful) and would like to meet someone of similar qualities, though I'm not above a sincere comment on your beauty and style, as long as it’s returned, every once in a while. Life takes us places, while we were where we were supposed to beIntelligent, educated, somewhat opinionated, always on the funny side of the street. I can be goofy to intense, given the right venue to express myself. High Tech personality, with a fun side that borders on the fringe of society. I can laugh at all that life brings our way, love the things we cannot change, read, converse, and understand, and I'm always faithful to the one I'm with. Though I've had my wild side, ;o. I'm comfortable in my own skin, and very comfortable in any social circumstance. I've met world leaders, and world creepers. I've lived a very diverse life. I've earned and maintain an advanced PhD in life, and if you make it within the circle, the tale is intriguing to say the least. I am an enigma. I'm conservative on some issues, and liberal on others. I think that makes me sane as well.... Born in the year of the Tiger and being a Virgo, I possess many of the qualities of the same (though also understand that its all mental BS). Cursed with intellect, many people can find me hard to decipher, though I fit well in all settings, and all groups. My favorite movie of all time is ""The Razor's Edge"" with Bill Murray, ""Everafter"", ""Dazed and Confused"" (My early life as seen through a camera) and I loved ""Joe Dirt"" as well. Some of my favorite books include “1984”, ""Freakonomics"", and ""The 10k Year Explosion"", “Why Orwell Matters” (anything by Hitchens), and “The Art of War”, though I'm versed in many other tastes as well. No, I’m not a vampire….. Anne Rice rocked the genre for me as a youth, but that was as far as that era went….Though I can participate in any sports activity, my game is darts. I love the competition and math aspect of the game and have competed and taught on the international level. I love movies, reading, swimming, kayaking, relaxing, biking, lazy weekend mornings in bed, and maintain a wide variety of additional interests. I do suffer from Cedar Fever, (and other allergies like dogs and cats, but that can just go f-off, since I can’t live without my animals, breathing can take a back seat…. lol) though it looks like I've found the cure. Oops, spoke to soon. I carry the experience of life, as everyone our age does, though I’ve learned that not everyone can see or deal with it. We've made it this far in life for a reason, to go on until we go no more. So why not do it with a smile? I sometimes skate in Austin with the adult crowd on Tuesday nights. Seems I forgot somewhere down my path, how much fun I used to have, plus I like the exercise. I live my life, and want someone to share my time with. I'll have a drink only on very special occasions, (is wine still considered alcohol?) but don't mind if you do at all. My past makes me highly friendly in a non partaking manner, but again, don't mind either way. I see it this way, we’ll know it’s right once we’ve spent some time together. Let's meet up. The woman I seek is capable of emotions; love, anger, joy and sorrow, or any additions from beyond the afore mentioned. I’m flexible. I'm looking to feel the welling in my being, the breeze across my face as we wind through the hills, or pass the time away watching a meteor shower from out in the country. I want that spark. I can deal with hippies, prom queens, political activists, professionals, parents, loners, flirts, lovers, independents, romantics or social gadflies. Must love animals, I currently house-sit a mediocre (slightly less than great) Dane, a Boxer/lab mix I was told (though she looks remarkably like a miniature Rottie) and a stray orange cat who are all rescues and more than a handful. We're a package deal BTW. No exceptions there.Please have an open mind, and not someone who deals in absolutes, or deal breakers. Our lives in this world encompasses a myriad of facets that all interact within this very big place, and you never know where or what the next big thing will be, or where life will take you. Adventure and fun are not mutually exclusive, and neither is work and sorrow, or the very pleasant aspect of just being. We'd all like to be somewhere else from time to time. I'd just prefer that you spend most of your time in the here & now.

This is nothing more than a marketing “teaser”. You can’t get the full picture until you meet me, and spend a while walking around in the well-worn moccasins of life. And to that end, I’ll state here where you can find me most weekends 9:45ish – 10:45ish am. I eat my breakfast on the Bastrop bridge overlooking the Colorado river among the Locks of Love, Mystery and Broken Dreams. If you feel adventurous, or have a curious streak within your being, grab your folding chair (or we can sit on the ground, I’m flexible) a bowl of flakes, some milk and berries, or whatever flips your boat, and join me.

If you pass me by because you don't want to take the time to just barely scratch the surface of what I'm about, then thank you...you just made my shiny needle that much more visible!I grew up in Houston, but have lived in the Austin area for the past 30 years. I am honest, hard-working, and a very loving man who's easygoing and loves to have fun. I enjoy traveling (especially somewhere tropical), hiking (I love Colorado in the summer and Big Bend in the early spring and fall), working out, going to the movies, eating out, weekend brunches, going to the gun range, fast roller coasters and amusement parks, hanging out with friends, and just hanging out at home with that special someone. I also have a very strong love for motorcycles and fast cars. I eat clean and workout 5 times a week. It's important to me to stay healthy and fit, and I'm looking for someone who feels the same. I'm 59 but I don't want to look, and I especially don't want to feel like most 59 year old men. I am also a proud veteran of the United States Navy. And on that note, as a veteran and citizen of the greatest country in the world...I absolutely, positively can not stand Donald J. Trump! I think he is a criminal, a racist, a traitor, a disgrace to this country, and an all around disgusting human being! Yeah, I probably should have led with that in my ""Headline"", probably would have saved some of you some time. If I lost you with that comment, sorry... No actually I'm not sorry! OK, so here's where I'm probably going to lose a lot of you. I do watch a little football (usually just the playoffs and the Superbowl), and I do enjoy going to the occasional hockey game in Cedar Park, but I'm definitely not a huge sports fan. I refuse to spend my precious free time sitting in front of a TV all day! I only drink occasionally so I don't really care for the bar scene, but I do enjoy listening to live music. I love my guns and will never turn down a day at the range, but I do not like to hunt and fish. I have nothing against doing that, just not for me. Neither is camping, unless we're talking about a condo, resort, or 5 star hotel with a king size bed, shower and toilet...then I'm all in! I'm not much of a dancer either, but if you're willing to teach me I'm willing to try. I can grill pretty good, but not a very good cook in the kitchen. However, if you need a good sous-chef, I'm your man. Sorry if those last few details are deal breakers, but I thought I'd should put it out there.I'm not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. Like everyone, I've made mistakes in the past, but I feel like I have grown from them. I make a conscious effort to consistently learn and grow everyday, and to give myself the tools I need to always work at being a better version of myself. The past can not be changed, but I will not let the past define my future.If I haven't lost you yet and you're still reading this, then that's perfect because you're the one that this part applies to. There are a lot of attributes I'm looking for in my life partner, but I truly believe there has to be chemistry and a strong physical attraction. I'm looking for a woman with like interests, and one who will expand my horizons! First and foremost, I'm looking for that special someone. Someone who I enjoy being with and who enjoys being with me, and I can be best friends with! I'm looking for that special woman that I can love, spoil, cherish, and adore...and who will want to do the same for me. That woman who puts a smile on my face, and makes my heart skip a beat every time she walks into the room. The one who makes me smile when I first open my eyes in the morning, because she's laying there next to me looking like an angel. That person that I can't stop thinking about when we're apart, and I can't stop loving on when we're together. That special woman whose beauty is not only on the surface, but also runs deep, deep into her soul... and who will light a fire deep into my soul.

I'm not a biker; I drove the chase truck/trailer. Please do not write me if you are a democrat. 1.) My Hobbies--- I have a collection of tools and gadgets like most men I hang out with. I do just about all my own home and car maintenance to get exercise. I enjoy shopping on my smart phone and at contractor supply stores. I canned 36 pints (48 lb) of fruit jam mid August. So good! I also enjoy cooking meats esp grilling T-bone steaks.2.) My Goals---Get rid of everything and move to a newly built state-of-the-art home that is professionally furnished, decorated, and maintained near Georgetown TX. Probably won't happen because I like my old things too much. But if I meet the right woman my goals will adapt to our relationship. I would like and need a companion. We will both be happy.3.) My Taste In Music--- Have collected music of all genre; steel guitar my fav. Not interested in frog dancing but might enjoy taking ballroom dancing classes with a partner. Would like to play in a dance band.4.) Unique--- The period of time I grew up was simple (the greatest generation). We didn't have electricity until I was six.  Mother cooked on a wood stove before that. She had seven kids and I am the youngest. We had a wonderful farm/ranch with good soil. We were self sufficient. Weekend gatherings were at homes of neighbors or relatives and Church picnics in the summer. The churches were the social hub. I was always kept busy (livestock, crops), had good health, good in math, earned an engineering degree from UT Austin. I can relate to just about anyone who is reasonable, except democrats. I am sobered by the fact that every life on this planet has it's own little world and that my little world is no more important than anyone else's and neither is yours. But we are responsible for own little worlds. I am an engineer; not a comedian, banker, lawyer, or doctor. But I am a trustworthy companion and heavy lifter. I was coddled by my family and friends and enjoyed that. In return I will move mountains if they're not too big. We all want attention but there are givers and there are takers.5.) I Wonder--- it is clear that feminists enjoy seeing men suffer to pay for their sins. It's gotten pretty bad. It's not an ""equal"" thing; feminists don't need men and say so. I see traits of feminism in most women I meet and when I do I want to run the other way before I get into trouble !!! But there's a chance a woman who is a fit is on here and will write me !!

Or dancing in boots and heels til we drop... I'm big on showing my feelings, even when in public, and usually hold hands or are arm-in-arm when out. I have no problem with PDA (but don't put on a show... well sometimes). I enjoy movies and dining out, concerts, visiting friends, kayaking on Town Lake, mountain biking Walnut Creek, sunsets or sunrises on Mt Bonnell, hiking Enchanted Rock and impromptu picnics in parking lots. The emphasis is on doing things with that certain someone. I don't have to be with her every minute of every day, but when I am, it's important she understands I am WITH HER. I've known real love before... colors are brighter, smells are sweeter, sounds clearer... more happiness than I ever dreamed possible... all that stuff. Yeah, as I reread this, it sounds like drivel to me also, but you understand once you've been there. And I want it again... long term.** Profile Update**As you might have guessed, I'm a rather physically active guy. I workout, run, mountain bike, kayak or dance at least 5 or 6 times a week.

Whether in turns out that I am your prince (much too soon to tell), your frog (I work really, really hard to avoid that sobriquet :), or just a non-entity to you, thanks for stopping by because we are all on this crazy, exciting, journey of life together.So let me introduce myself by saying that I truly love my life—there cannot be a luckier man in the world. Just the joy I get from being with my two grown children lets me claim the title of luckiest man. But I also get to sail Galveston Bay, Lake Travis & occasionally the BVI or Med. With a season ski pass to Steamboat now good all over the continent, I look forward to finding all kinds of steep hills to fall down. Being outdoors—whether boating, competing in sand volleyball tournaments, playing tennis, biking or hiking, of just sitting around absorbing the glory of nature all bring a little song to my heart. Though I never find the time to watch TV alone, I read a lot, love music, and the Arts, like to cook (with or for someone), and have been taking dance lessons to improve my limited but enthusiastic skills. But there’s something about travel that really appeals to me especially to foreign lands with people, cultures, foods, art, history and architecture all so different but with so many common threads. I guess I have ventured out of the US maybe 50 times and I am ready to go 50 more. Great health, great friends, & being lucky (mostly) in business all make me amazingly fortunate.One other thing, as the luckiest man in the world, it would be incredibly selfish of me not to share. While I don't do it nearly enough I do take great joy in having supported a range of charities. I am greatly honored (with my ex-wife) to have a classroom named after us at YES Prep, and to be on the Hall of Honor at the Houston Area Women's Center. I have also actively supported Camp for All, The Children's Assessment Center, Poe Elementary, PACE Youth, the Alley Theater (Gold Circle Member), St. John's School, UT, the NAACP, ACT Blue, WWF, et alia.By the way, although I currently living mostly in Austin, I am able to spend as much time as I want in Houston and Steamboat since I have an interest in each place. I will pick one of the three (or someplace else) for my main residence soon (and visit the others).

Having worked in the medical profession in trauma, orthopedics and being a care giver, said experiences has made me realize that what is preached by the media, the marketers and society is not what is most valued in life. Material possessions do not define an individual but compassion, empathy. love for family, friends, and those less fortunate. It is no surprise to anyone that life is fleeting but many view life, their partners, family, friends for granted. My parents were married for over 60 years, never lost that zeal, love for one another. On separate occasions, young couples, unbeknownst to my parents, introduced themselves, spoke of how beautiful the love my parents exhibited with one other and even purchased their meal. It is this love what I seek in a partner, a love that is steadfast and true, no matter what plays before us. By nature, I am a hopeless romantic, an unabashed giver and pleaser to my partner. Possession of a vivid imagination, so many ways to physically sate my partner's physical and emotional needs. A proponent of strong communication and listening skills, which is paramount in a relationship. Firmly believe in the setting aside of pride, and be the first to apologize. Nature is very important to me and hopefully as well for my partner. Hiking, camping, kayaking, tandem cycling, gardening. nature watching, devote of the beach and mountains. A lover of the vernacular, languages, arts, good books, culinary exploration, wine tastings. Are you that person in life who shares similar attributes, an outlook for life?

My friends say I am a happy-hearted man. At this stage in life, I'm not concerned with the so-called baggage, because there’s no person at my age without a heartedly filled historical past of trial and accomplishment. The lines on my face are testament. (I’m attributed with more smile lines than sad lines.)For my soulmate: You see, I'm most passionate in searching for my once in a lifetime special relationship. The endurance of life’s give & take has gifted me with tenacity and strength. Tough times do not last; it’s the reaction to such which assimilates into the core fabric of existence; and with it, gifted only one vaporous life to live. And while I have life, I will hold my someone's hand like I will never get another chance. I will kiss like I only have this one perfect moment; and when I look into the eyes of my someone special, I will look at them as if it’s the last time I will ever see them. I will watch over and protect my someone while they sleep; like there's no tomorrow. And I will love my someone special because they are the only one in this world. I take comfort in sharing my one hope will rest in unconditional love. Proving to me the journey is worth the reward and to rest easy with the shared heart of another in total accomplishment.So a little more to share about me. I’m a well to do, clean cut professional. I have a balance between “old-school” traditions and acceptance of the new. Overtime, I've personally applied my own flavor of self-improvement and have learned much. I will never stop growing into more of who I’m intended to be. I have much to share and enjoy with my someone special; overtime in authenticity. The closest loved ones in my life mean the world to me and possess all the qualities I hope to find in my special companion. I believe it foremost to nurture the wonderful people in my life who also practice positivity. I enjoy dedicating my life to those who are transparent and considerate; whom are great communicators, a lively character through demonstration of ethics, loyalty and core values. I want a compliment which possesses HUGE empathy and compassion for others, aspires to but not fixated/addicted at an attempted healthy lifestyle. (No Vegans Please!) I'm looking for a heart flooded with raw honesty and integrity. I am and have been told by others that I’m fiercely loyal to the people I love! With this, it “inspires” me to live life with a passion second to none; time is short; and I don’t waste my time anymore on things that do not matter. So I encourage you to jump if you feel like jumping, run if you feel like running, sing a song and dance to music in your head when there is none, and enjoy that special home-cooked meal, especially the desert, like it's the last one left in the world!To learn more about me... that will require interaction.

So here it goes.I was born and raised in Kansas (nope, I've never seen a live tornado). I am Hispanic pretty much by heritage only, as both sets of grandparents were born in Mexico. I do not speak Spanish. Hey, it's who I am. But I would like to learn it, should the opportunity arise.I moved to Austin in September of 2017. My son moved his family here, so I followed them to Texas. After raising my son, the thought of seeing my two granddaughters (now 11 and 13) grow up made me feel good. It was no fun to only see them once or twice a year, as they lived in Pennsylvania and I lived in Kansas. My plan is to retire right before the oldest one graduates from high school (of course, that could change). I live north of The Arboretum. I am not good at long distance relationships, so I would only like to meet women with 50 miles of Austin. I'm looking for a good friend, one that I'd like to be with all of the time (not that it is necessary, but I just want you to know that would be nice). It would be great if you were sensual, a good kisser, like to be touched, likes to get and give hugs, you have and appreciate a good sense of humor, a good communicator, and likes to receive foot and body massages. Really, I'd just like to share the air in the room with you.I play drums/percussion in concert and symphonic bands. I've been doing this for years! I play here in Austin and in San Antonio (playing at a 4th of July concert with the San Antonio Symphonic Band in Comfort).I am a non-practicing Catholic. Haven't been to Mass since a brothers funeral in January 2015. And I do not get along with cats (something happened when I was a little kid and it still bothers me). And I do not ride motorcycles, and never will. Oh, and if you voted for 45 and still believe he is a great guy, then we would not be a good match. I haven't paid the extra dollars for 'Meet Me'.

I strive for honesty and well-being to others.  Probably considered a few extra pounds came from the fact that I cook rather well and not just the Texas favorite-BBQ.Hmm okay, being single I have developed some poor habits too :( Qualities :) I do well with mechanical repairs and not bad with construction repairs/skills. Now gardening, landscape maintenance is okay, but my green thumb keeps turning brown. Golf is an activity/social events that keeps me additionally active. Used to, I was exposed to farm/ranch life, did my share of riding horses and working cattle and was in the middle of numerous other country animals-some of the best of times. Maybe I should mention water activities, since I grew up in the coastal region fishing, skiing, swimming and lots of beach time. There is very little drama in life, BUT WAIT, I have grown kids; so that presents ???  Life has tried and blessed me in many different ways.

Alas, there shall be, dear reader, much more to be determined and added to this profile, some to be removed, because this is in all reality a continuing work in progress, and it will morph and redefine itself periodically... This 'version' was UPDATED 08/27/2019...  Forlornly, I propose to you that I'm just absolutely nuts, but that does allow for life to be much more enjoyable... As for myself, there are many things that have factored into the discovering of my outlook of life, my life itself, and how I cope with life... I work through so many things daily just to keep my head up, just to be told that I hide behind my humor... Maybe I do... I do just fine, but acknowledge that there is something missing in my life... I am not here for just physical intimacy (one night stands, 'friends with benefits', to be used for your getting revenge on your significant other because he cheated on you, or to be used to reunite you with your husband because you are separated), but rather on here to find friends of substance and character... That being said, I realize that we cannot see things in just black and white, you lose far too many gradients... I am seriously looking for friends... Are you looking to find a FRIEND, first and foremost? Do you have time for a friend? I do...Meeting someone new is like getting a book, not knowing anything about it... You have to hold it, to see it, to read it, give it some thought and attention... Each day of our lives, begins as being likened to the beginning of a chapter, some with possibly just a few intense passages... You learn something about it every time you flip the page. Do you wonder how it will end, Good or Bad, or will it confuse you? You cannot know until you spend enough time with it... Will you like the book? Will you love it? Will you hate it? Will you judge it and give it away before you even finish it?I believe you must be friends before you can consider moving forward, however I am not opposed to furthering a friendship with the right lady, but a lady she must be... If that is too literal, well I will NOT settle again... I really am getting tired of finding those who have hidden agendas on this site... Someday I do want someone will strive with me for a 'Wants me - Desires me - Can't live without me kind of relationship', but I am cautious and weary in the thought of sharing my past because it has been held against me too many times to abuse me emotionally... I don't need anyone to disrupt my insanity, but it is an awful lot of fun at times with the right person... I do just fine, but acknowledge that there is something missing in my life... But lately I find that most days I have nobody to go and have fun with... I am single by choice, not for lack of opportunity... Sometimes I like doing things by myself, I actually do happen to like my own company, all of me... As long as I still have that, I am never bored... I have my volunteer work, my Riverwalk excursions, my movies, my cat who is my babysitter (he needs his own time to himself now and again, LOL)... I pretty much come and go as I please, when I please... I will probably return to college, just keep learning, and am thinking of working towards becoming a volunteer counselor, I have experience in certain categories, LOL...If you have taken the time to read this far, I say ""Thank you kind soul""... I have taken the time to add images to my profile along with captions that accompany those images that are profound at times... And for you whom actually does read another's profile, just in case you did not know, all you have to do is left click on a picture in my profile, and it will expand the photo/image to the full frame of the picture, revealing hidden things, and in doing this, you can also read the captions or music(via YouTube) that I've attached to each one, and hopefully my efforts will have brought just the simplest of smiles to your day (maybe even hope?)... Do you think of others? Are you willing to give of your time to help people you do not even know? I do considerable volunteer work and it would be nice to meet others that are willing to give of their 'free' time to join me in working volunteer events...In conclusion, I confess that my profile is a little bit winded, but all in all, I believe it is a good read, although I am no writer nor poet... Who knows, you can really NEVER have too many friends, and we should always try to remember that our next friend is still a stranger to us right now, and we will never meet them unless we set out to find friends by just, ""putting ourselves out there""... I am not an upgraded paid member, so I cannot see who clicks that they want to 'meet me'... So if there if it turns out that there is an interest on your behalf, take a chance and send a message... I was raised to be a gentleman (""...Momma tried, Momma tried..."", LOL) and have manners, I have some old fashioned values and views, but I would not look down upon a lady who messages me first... Is it that you might be a little bit shy, or has someone hurt you also, and you are cautious? We are all a little bit shy in our own way(s), and we have all had a relationship turn sour...

I have a career that gives me many blessings so I don’t need or want your money, just being honest. I’ve been divorced seven years, empty nester, and drama free!! I desire a drama free woman to grow old with. So, if your married or separated, resolve your issues and let the ink dry on your divorce papers before reaching out to me. Also, I am one that will read your entire profile. While your cleavage pics are nice, if your using your boobs to sell yourself, you’re going to loose my attention. Without saying, I first and foremost want to learn who you are and what are the things in life that make your heart go thump, thump, and thump.What do I want out of life. I had a life changing event in 2017 that opened my eyes to life is precious and we need to make the most of it today, for tomorrow is not a guarantee. So I only post pics of my travels to show me enjoying life. And, if you take notice yes I’m posting pics of baseball stadiums. I’m currently doing a stadium tour which means I’m going to all baseball major league stadiums to watch a baseball game. For those that don’t know baseball, that’s 28 different cities in the U.S. (New York and Chicago has two different teams.) Since April of this year, I’ve done 9 so far, 21 more to go. So now is the time to travel at will. Because I was asked this question, I’ll answer it now. No I’m not with a different woman at every city!! If I get involved with a woman here in San Antonio that wishes to share this experience with me all the much better, otherwise I will still go to them alone because lack of companionship will not stop me. It is what it is. Should we become involved, I will also ask that you please have a passport because Caribbean vacations in my book are a must. I make it a point to go to one country each year. Hope I’m not too demanding!! LolWho am I? I desire a monogamous relationship. I will not get involved in a long distance relationship because they’re proven to not work. Plus, I want the ability to get off of work and say hey babe let’s go relieve some stress. So more than 35 miles outside of SA it’s pushing the outer boundary, but I will make considerations if you capture my attention. I believe faithfulness and communication are the foundations to a relationship. I’m not a jealous man because jealousy only says I don’t trust you which erodies faithfulness. I understand my significant other needs her time also, so I have no issues with her doing her thing on occasion. Hey we can meet for breakfast and laugh about the events of the evening. There is so much more to say but I find women don’t read this far because they only shop for eye candy by the pics men post. No wonder so many women are angry when they keep getting catfished!!

Sorry but I do not do all the winks, meets, favorites, and chemistry mumbo-jumbo with just anyone. If you base this on photos mainly and or it is about your fun and entertainment, GO FISH! I am old school. Anyone for free even WITHOUT good English can set up a minimal profile as a DECOY even if they are not active here, ready, willing or able. Sadly, even the paid sites are little different as sites do not change the people on them. Please do not try to ""meet me"" quickly!Decades ago I learned how risky face to face interviews were for making decisions about people without reviewing all objective information first. If you chose not to write similarly to carefully define yourself and what you seek I will not likely move to speak on the phone and meet you. I choose not to argue with you about just making this easy by meeting, texting or phoning either. It is possible to consider SKYPE or Face-Time after you have caught up to all my disclosures. Back at matching again and quite new to San Antonio! Previous experience taught that most were just here cause it makes them feel good to at least think they might be GIFTED a great generous partner! Getting the mail and attention is fun and gratifying too. On POF one can even get away doing it fast, easy and free irresponsibly toward others. SO FEW bother to WRITE MUCH OF A NARRATIVE, ANSWER MAIL nor get involved in TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT. Worse, almost no one will even tolerate nor cooperate with others trying to do it WELL.I will be taking things slow so if you can't be patient you will just punish yourself! I am GENUINE, PATIENT and COMMITTED so if you are the normal JUST fun and entertainment oriented gal GO FISH! Just because I am so focused does not mean I can not be both fun and extremely entertaining and cooperative too.I am recently fully retired with plenty of time for a wonderful partner to work toward building a great life in retirement! A partner is not a convenience to me for fun, to make my life enjoyable or entertain me either. They are far more important and crucial unquestionably than just a servant or sexual surrogate. I do not seek marriage to trap or control.Defining myself: Stable, reliable and dependable physically, mentally, and financially. Love people but know few are truly trustworthy, loyal and reliable. I am a story/joke teller to amuse and entertain others! Modest to a fault, anti-narcissistic, not pretentious not superficial. Caring, careful intense passionate and generous. A bit volatile when upset but cool down very quickly. Do not pout for days. Almost never cold and distant. affectionate and warm. Religious foundation but more spiritual now, overeducated, kinda structured and stiff. Handy, skillful, mechanically gifted and easily attend to much detailed work. Articulate, low maintenance, caring, mature, intelligent, considerate, courteous, well mannered, mostly happy. Communicative, constructive, effective, Honest to a fault. Generous. Not Petty.Prefer dogs to cats and other animals. Love animals but they are a tremendous responsibility daily. Work to keep things simple and manageable. Prefer country dramatically to city. Prefer simple foods to gourmet and exotic cooking. Rather eat healthy mostly at home but not yet on a plant based diet. Not a real good housekeeper or homemaker/nester but I am not messy! A rudimentary basic cook. Intolerant of myself misleading others. Despise those taking advantage of people especially the less fortunate. Insist on being fair to others. Do not tolerate physical violence but I too often get too loud. Tend to be cooperative especially when something is well planned. Not basically adventurous, am easily entertained and tend to not work to find entertainment. I prefer traveling to places where there are family and friends. Avoid cautiously venturing into bad neighborhoods and many foreign countries. Less comfortable in large crowds. Not possessive, demanding nor controlling despite my primary type A personality and some real stubbornness. I am one of the small minority that tends not to fail to have a plan. Seek substance over superficiality and maturity over youth.Decades back when I last dated FEW were NOT overwhelmed with work, family and friends thereby unfit without the time for quality coupling I am in search of that rare lady with plenty of time who is ready to move forward building a high quality life together in retirement.

Qualities Sought In that special Partner:I am not looking for a twin but a partner in goals that often gets there differently than I might. Plenty of free time to share! If you keep a neat clean house and cook ""meat and potatoes stuff"" well along with being physically, financially and emotionally stable and reliable, great! If you TREASURE A PARTNER above almost anything, we agree about our most important goal! If that partner truly is to be more important than your job, house, friends and maybe even family then we are close! If you DO NOT withhold the uncomfortable things you would prefer to not disclose, we might be safe together. If you want to set up exercise most days and try to stay as active physically and mentally as possible, very good. If you prefer eating healthy at home, good. If you are NOT afraid of missing out on most of those big social events and crowds, great. If your partner's frequent gentle caring touch and kisses are far more gratifying than gold, jewelry, or even compliments and gifts, we match. If you don't just want to keep re-dealing the relationship cards playing the hand badly time and again, you may just understand. If you allow going slowly so we can both work, while aging, to learn new choices and better habits together, good. If you know with certainty aging requires lots of changes and compromise, great.If you cannot both understand and appreciate what you have just read of respect, dignity, and sincerity we are less likely to couple well.Why all the work and communication is unavoidable?If I do not match most of your needs and you do not match most of mine DO AGREE we would be unwise to even try to meet!",Non-Smoker with Thin body type," San antonio, Texas ","65 year old Male, 5' 8"" (173cm), Jewish",Caucasian,rusteanail wants to find someone to marry.,PhD / Post Doctoral,Free Thinker,retired Physician,Woman,Long Term,Viewhis relationship needs,View his chemistry results,No,Does not want children,Single,No,Bald,Brown,Yes,No,Over 10 years,Ambitious,No Pets,,65,M,Scorpio

I am attracted to intelligent, joyful, playful, silly and emotionally stable gals with a lot of personality. Am looking for someone possessing very good communication skills. I am currently reading the book, ""The 5 Love Languages.""You are someone truly special. You are known by your friends to be a Godly lady with ministerial gifts for people because you love people, have an understanding heart and seek the Lord for wisdom. You are a gal with an upbeat perspective. There is a possibility you have set yourself aside for a while, rather than be in-and-out of relationships. You are someone who can spot a pearl of great price because you are one.Things I like I like good conversation, nature walks, family talk, playing pool, health food, share cooking ideas, invention idea sharing, family values, dogs, auto maintenance, computer talk, sports talk, good cup of coffee, giving back rubs, handy man work, solitaire and watching some movies or TV. (TV for the most part is boring) I used to enjoy a Padres game a few times a year but this year it is tough. I like the Red Sox, Patriots and Celtics (all Boston sports teams because I am originally from the North East). I am not much into the casinos other than dining. I could watch someone for a while. I like shopping the bargain / clearance stores especially the factory outlets. Mature guy who doubles as Mr Fix-it. The storage shed project is done. More work than I estimated. One photo here is related to a project. Does this happen to you? At the start of a project you are all gungho but the last 10% is a real grind, details.. details.. and more trips to Home Depot & Lowes. I don't consider myself a cook rather I have specialties I do well. I like to make my own BBQ seasoning - lots of Black Pepper etc, I like to slow cook Whole Bean Vegitable Soups (lentil, barley, black eye peas etc...) during the winter months and for the summer a Mediterranean Vinaigrette Salad made with Light cold press Olive Oil, Balsamic Vinegar, Liquid Aminos, Worcestershire Sauce, Fresh Lemon Juice, Mrs. Dash - All Natural no salt Seasoning, Garlic, Red Onions, Green Onions, White Onions, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts, Cilantro, Mushrooms, Vine Ripe Tomatoes, Celery, and Cabbage. (I really should not be sharing such personal information. :))Recently have taken a fancy to cooking with a Cast Iron Griddle on the BBQ.POF's personality tests say I am: Extraverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving.[""Let's make work fun"": Free-spirited, nervy and nonconforming. If the work is not fun, tends to avoid or drop the issue and move on to something different. Very sociable type who enjoys high energy and jovial interaction. Can keep many projects moving at once. Strength is allowing others to be different and work at an individual pace. Good in big, bureaucratic organizations. Can work the system for the good of all involved. ESFP's natural partner is the ISTJ, or ISFJ. ESFP's dominant Extraverted Sensing function is best matched with a personality that is dominated by Introverted Sensing.] However I wonder why two Extraverted Sensing would not be a great match also? Go figure.I smoke cigars, not cheapies but good cigars (Montecristo, Romeo y Julieta, La Gloria, Arturo Fuente etc.) BTW.. smoke from a good cigar is aromatic similar to a pipe. Cigarette smoke is very different.Observations. Some POF intros are one long paragraph. I wonder if people realize the message it sends? To me, ... complicated.

I am here looking for a woman. I don't care if you are white, black, brown or yellow. I just like an even-tempered, slightly crazy woman with a civilized side. Loves physical contact. Has curves, not hills. I work hard to look decent. Some people don't have to do squat to look good. I am envious. Women either like my looks or don't. No 'on the fence' ladies. That's fair. If we contact each other, that is a start. I read a profile that said, ""if you write and I don't answer, it means I was not inspired. I will assume the same if I write to you"". Then we both know what to expect. It's hard to be polite with rejection. It happens. It's the Internet. I have the free membership here. Messages always come in. I got very tired of the 'want to meet' deal. That is just sticking your fingers in the water. Not like the whole bath. Immersion is a good word. I find, on a dating site, the long descriptive terms are never the 'catch' to this venue. If someone is captured by your looks, and you, theirs. Act on it. There is less BS. Chance encounters are what fuels the flames. I am an ex-college athlete, so I stay in shape from the love of exercise and habit. Irreverant. Intelligent and Inquisitive. I aspire to be content, happy and satisfied. Well-traveled, speak one language well and can be rude in a few. I like all music except for rap. If you don't try here, it's like going to the carny ring toss booth. If you don't try to toss a ring around a bottleneck, you have no chance of winning the 'soft' kitty. As far as a further description goes. Please ask. I feel it's just as good to tell a couple of Louisiana jokes. Better entertainment for the read. I will be glad to trade stories and histories. 3 fellows were having a drink. A Texan, an Arkansas man, and a Louisiana Cajun. The Texan asked the question of what was the best invention in the last 50 years. He said, he thought it was the computer, the man from Arkansas said he thought it was a microwave, the Cajun said he thought it was the thermos bottle. His companions said, "" Plauche, what the Hells that about""? Plauche responded, ""how do it know""? Pierre, Sustan, and Guidry used to go fishing in Whiskey Bay. For years they spent many a weekend pulling up fish, drinking and telling lies. One day Guidry said, ""guys, I gotta tell y'all somethin. Pierre and Sustan turned to him and Guidry said. 'Guys I need to let you know I am going to die. His friends were shocked and said ""what the Hell, Guidry, what's up"". Guidry said I got dem der Aids. His friend were aghast. Guidry was a widow but never showed gay tendencies. They asked him how it could be. Guidry hung his head and said after his wife died he got lonely and just fell into it. His friends were despondent. Guidry continued and said the doctor had given him just a few weeks to live. He said I need a favor from you two when I die. ""Sure"", they both agreed. ""anything"". Guidry said ""this getting together and fishing has been the biggest joy in my life. When I die I want my body cremated and you two to come out here and pour my ashes into Whiskey Bay. Sustan and Pierre both agreed. Several weeks later Guidry, sadly passed. The next weekend, after the funeral, Sustan and Pierre took his ashes out on to the water. Pierre went to throw them overboard and Sustan stopped him and said "" Hey Pierre, you gots to say sumthin before you commit him back to the earth"". Pierre said ""You right"" he pondered a thought for a second or two and as he poured the ashes in the murky water he said ""Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust, poor Guidry, if you only liked that P---y, youd still be here wid us"" Amen... One from the UK. A boy is born. Unfortunately, there was only a head. No torso, no arms or legs. But healthy. The parents loved him, no matter what. On his 18th birthday, the father takes him out to a pub for his first pint. The boy takes a sip and WOOOSH. Out pops the torso. The crowd in the pub holler ""take another sip"". Then WOOOSH out pops his arms. The boy then takes a third sip and WOOOSH, outcome his legs. The boy is so excited he runs out of the pub, straight into the street and WHAM he is hit by a truck and dies.

What I really like...fitness...been a physical and food ""health nut"" my entire life. But currently struggling with motivation. A mutual interest in weight training would be huge plus. Remodeling my home. Warmer weather (under 70 is cold for this body)! What interests me...Science, The History Channel, WWII documentaries, computers, ""thriller"" and ""mystery"" type movies (can you tell I have Netflix?), personal growth, some travel (I do have a lightly used passport), real estate, politics (for full transparency, left-leaning moderate), college (but not pro) football, basketball, law, learning another language...so much to do, so little time! What I don't care much about...religion, hunting, fishing, golfing, dancing (except on very festive occasions). What is a preference (but not entirely a deal breaker)...height, weight proportionate to height, longer hair, other Fire Signs and Scorpios, ability to put together back to back intelligent sentences. No or small tattoos. A balanced view of life and a good sense of HUMOR! Honesty is assumed here, and reciprocated. What is a turn-off...cigarette smoking, hard drug use, excessive cell phone usage, gold diggers and drama queens. And for transparency...my quirks...Don't eat beef, pork, deli-style meats, fried foods, or have much use for salt or sugar. (The latter has been really tough lately :) ).

Our lifestyle predominately entailed living off the land we lived upon by raising domestic animals, vegetables, and alfalfa for the animals - a lot of physical and routine work. I decided to use my brain instead of my back, as far as my career was concerned. Fortunately I attended college on a basketball scholarship, and acquired both a BS/MS in Environmental Science. For 24 years, I worked within the Occupational Health, Environmental Affairs, and Safety discipline for 5 Fortune 200 companies. Then fortunately in early 2003, I decided to permanently take my wrist watch off (no children to finance through college), let my hair fly freely, and truly enjoy the fortunate freedom of having time on my side to devote to three of my passions ""Traveling-Trekking-Still Imagery"". So I purchased some good quality digital camera equipment, along with some reliable hiking and backpacking gear and have been enjoying our precious and precarious planet ""Yakni"" ever since. The most recent adventure was the summer of 2018 in ICELAND, which was the coldest and rainiest in more than 100 years, which equated to waterfalls and rivers at wonderful extremes. Yes, I enjoy the outdoors for it truly makes me happy and relaxed when out experiencing its educational wonders.

I also have a luv-therapy for chasing the dimpled ball around the links, which I joyously undertake weekly (if around Marble Falls). Also a cooking/eating healthy passion, but I also indulge a smidgeon with the junk/sweets/paka too. And for sure my passion of ""Enjoying my fortunate freedom of TIME on my side"".

I'm a Christian guy who grew up in Chicago but have lived in Texas most of my adult life. My friends tell me that I am outgoing, fun, adventuresome, trustworthy, sincere, organized, witty, spontaneous, and affectionate. I like to travel near and far, camp and hike in the mountains (I love Big Bend, Rocky Mountain National Park, and Glacier National Park), go for long walks, play tennis, snow ski, play golf, watch sports, try new things, be original, have great conversation, laugh, smile, and get to know people. I also like garage-saling and antiquing (Round Top and Warrenton are fun places I enjoy), and especially like watching UT sports in person or on TV. I also like going to a concert or musical. I'm not crazy about ballet, but I'd go if you were interested. I do like adventure and enjoy exploring the world at home here in Austin, the state, the country, and abroad. Love the National Parks and I truly feel it is one of America's best ideas. I've recently been to Tibet and to the base of Mt. Everest, and I also went on a fabulous expedition cruies to Antarctica. For adventure this year, I'm planning on leading a Christian singles trip to Kenya & Tanzania in November. Not much into watching programmed TV except sporting events and newsworthy items, but I do enjoy watching substantive movies like include A Beautiful Mind, Forest Gump, the Chronicles of Narnia, Life is Beautiful, On Golden Pond, and Notebook. I prefer a dinner-date rather than a movie-date as it afford more of an opportunity for conversation, and I also enjoy attending cultural events such as concerts, plays, and musicals. I also like creative dates such as a physical activity or making dinner together. I enjoy cold evenings in front of the fireplace and drinking hot chocolate or hiking in the mountains while staying at a log cabin. I like the changing of the seasons, enjoy the holidays and decorations (I especially like Christmas), and enjoy visiting family and friends, and staying connected. I feel more comfortable dressed casually but can dress up for special occasions. I like giving/receiving surprises, too (good ones, of course :) ). Regarding relationships, although I am happy as a person being single, I am very open to God's leading in this most important area to share my life with someone special. Family is important to me, too, and I enjoy staying connected. I'm not into the bar scene and I enjoy going to church, but I'm far from boring.

I was taught well by my conservative German Grandfather to not acquire debt and make your money count when you spend it. He also taught me how to live off the land. I am pretty much a homebody, but in the country on quite a few acres, you never know when it will become adventurous, or what you might see. I have just this year (2011) put a mobile home on my Mom's property in the woods in Comanche, Tx. It is very peaceful there, and I am in the process of moving there now and should be moved by the end of 2019. If you do not like living in the country or the fact that I am tight with my money, there is no reason to keep on reading. I may be tight, but I am not stingy. ""Some girls don't like boys like me, Ahh, but some girls do"". (words from one of my favorite songs, by Sawyer Brown) I was born and raised in Austin. I have been going to the Texas Hill Country since I was born. My mom has a small ranch in the woods between Llano, and Mason, and also some property in Comanche Texas. The place in Llano has been in the family since 1877, cattle is still raised there. I like to look for Indian artifacts on these places, or anywhere I am allowed to. I am a small engine mechanic (mainly lawnmowers) at my home in north central Austin. I used to be a mechanic at the City of Austin, where I used to work on police cars, police motorcycles, fire trucks, ambulances, and anything the city owned at the time. I don't drink, drug, or smoke, and I have no wife, kids, or debts. I go to Gold's Gym. I do not observe holidays with celebration. I do not believe in a deity, it seems if there was an almighty deity he would hand out some brain aneurysms during the horrible shootings happening here, or at least give the shooter a terrible case of the runs so he would feel so uncomfortable he would not follow through, just saying. I would prefer a long term relationship, but am open to the possibility of a no strings attached relationship. I am just a real guy, looking for a real gal. Who I'd like to meet:A down to earth self-sufficient, woman, that isn't too materialistic, with grown or no kids. It would be great if we enjoyed each others company enough that we both felt great about being with each other, and we missed each other when we were apart. I would rather remain the Lone Ranger than be in a bad relationship. I chose the dating category because we have to start there, but I would like to find my last and best girlfriend.

match_742,5d886cb86dcc122b63b1afb5,transpersonal,A Life of Transformative Meaning/Purpose,"['Transpersonal philosophy', 'Transpersonal practice', 'Jnana Yoga']","Many, many years ago I reached a point in life where I needed to answer the question of ""what am I alive for?"" After wrestling with this issue for awhile I came to the conclusion that I could not answer that question until I first answered another one: ""what is humanity alive for?"" Well, the picture kept getting larger until the question of ""what is the universe alive for?,"" became the fundamental question. For someone formally trained in accounting and business, with a very concretely-oriented mind, these sorts of questions were not easy to address, but addressing them and actualizing the answers has been what my life has been about now for more than a quarter of a century.In brief, my answers to the above questions involve aspiring to live a transpersonal life. A transpersonal life is one that is to be spirit-inspired and that serves a function for and as an integral part of the world. Such a life includes an inner mutation and an outer transformation, thereby changing both one's self and the world. The inner mutation involves changing the quality of one's will, thoughts, feelings, desires, emotions, and values. The outer transformation entails changing the quality of one's behavior and activity in the world, therefore also one's relationships with others. Such a mutation and transformation is to be founded upon, infused with, and impelled by an all-inclusive, universal, Divine Love-Compassion.One function of the inner mutation and outer transformation is to redirect one's allegiance from lesser wholes--one's family, people, country, etc.--to the greater planetary whole, that essence within which we live and move, and which IS our being. Another function is to contribute to the preparation of the foundation for a future global society. Such a contribution means to establish a new vision, way of life, and meaning for being; one that is based upon the Earth as the foundation--the Earth, in all of its material, biological, mental, and spiritual aspects.All of which is much easier said than done! (And saying it is not that easy either!) At any rate, following through with my aspiration I could probably be described as a very serious, disciplined, and highly-focused person, with extra helpings of sincerity, honesty, directness, sympathy, and empathy to go along with that!The driving force, the dharma of my life is to work towards and contribute to the establishment, sustentation, dissemination, and exemplification of the vision that infuses and guides the transpersonal way of life. Thus my interests are consonant with and actuated by that vision: transpersonal philosophy and practice (jnana and karma yoga?); personal and planetary transformation; world social, political, ecological/environmental, and spiritual issues and current events. I have formal training in accounting and general business, and psychology and counseling; and informal exposure and interests in many other areas. Among these areas are: spiritual philosophies, metaphysics, theosophy, history, diet and nutrition, etc. The works of Dane Rudhyar, Sri Aurobindo, Helena P. Blavatsky, and Arnold J. Toynbee have had a profound impact upon my development so far.The call and challenge of a pan-human rebirth, transfiguration, and global society is upon us. Let us, one and all, assume our responsibility for all-inclusive growth and transformation, and move forward in consciousness and participation, in service to the emerging World Community--the consummation of humanity as a whole. Let all those who are able to `hear,' answer that `vocation!'WHAT I AM LOOKING FORI am seeking someone who is interested in living FOR something, hence living a life of transformative Meaning and Purpose. There is a specific vision that guides the transpersonal life, and I am seeking a co-working companion who might come to feel a MISSION, a CALLING, to share in the establishment, sustentation, dissemination, and exemplification of that vision.Such a co-working companionship would be one that works towards the inner mutation and outer transformation mentioned above, and that manifests and radiates both as single persons and as partners, the following qualities: Tranquility, Serenity, Stillness, Equanimity, Autonomy, Centrality, Willingness, Discipline, Responsibility, Attunement, Receptivity, Adaptibility, Detachment, The Art of Letting Things Happen, Knowing Where One Belongs, Simplicity, Tolerance, Ease, Non-Identification, Comradeship, Personal Integrity, Service, Courage, Non-Possessiveness, Intellectual Honesty, Sensitivity, Discrimination, Equanimity in Love, Non-Competitive Efficiency, Creative Visualization, Self-Reliance, A Sense of Humor, Faith in the Future, Aspiration-Ardency, Hope-Expectancy, Sincerity, Perseverance, Gratitude, All-Embracing Openness, Empathy, Love-Compassion, Knowledge, Wisdom, Solidarity, Cooperation, Fulfillment, Communion, Self-Forgetfulness, Self-Surrender, Consecration to a Greater Whole, and MORE!May Divine Love-Compassion bring together the conscious co-producers for the transpersonal way, and may we become the foundation necessary to transform life and living into planetary acts of creative power!",Non-Smoker with Average body type," Austin, Texas ","64 year old Male, 5' 11"" (180cm), Other",Other Ethnicity,transpersonal is looking for a relationship.,Graduate Degree,,,Woman,Long Term,Not Completed,View his chemistry results,No,Prefer Not To Say,Single,No,Black,Brown,Yes, No,Over 10 years,,No Pets,,64,M,Scorpio

I have a great sense of humor - although somewhat twisted at times.I enjoy meeting friends for a beer or coffee and just hanging out. I also enjoy going out for dinner and drinks or hosting parties.

I tend to be quiet, shy and reserved around people I don't know...although I have been coming out of my shell more lately.I am active and energetic. I enjoy mountain climbing, snowboarding, racquetball, martial arts, rollerblading, reading, and movies. I love sailing, but I don't get a chance to do that. I am athletic, but never got involved with many team sports.I love all animals and have a cat.

There is more to life than just year round weather.I am not really sure where to start as I have not been dating for over 25 years so I will not try to sound like a rambling man.I little about me, I was born in Germany and my family moved here to the states when I was 7. I grow up in a small town at the time called Bakersfield. Now before you go knocking this town it was very different back then, let's remember American graffiti was based on this town. I learned how to hunt, fish, camp and appreciate the simple things in life.After high school I went on to the Air Force and became a pilot before resigning my commission (LtCol) for an early out in 1995 and just 3 years short of retirement. After leaving the Air Force I worked for a large Aerospace company in San Diego as their supply chain manager until 2005 when I started my own business.I have never smoked or tried any drugs and i am also not into the bar/club scene. Got that out of my system early.Some of my interests/hobbies are scuba diving, sport/just for fun shooting, riding Jetskis, building wooden ship models and most recently working with my German Sheppard and starting to enter her in competitions. The photo of me is with one of the Golden's I had, her name is Lucy and she passed away this past February just 3 days before my birthday. Some things of what I have to offer you are simple.I would like to be your best friend, to look out for you and to always have your back and right or wrong, always stand up for you. However if I think your wrong well talk about.To be open and honest with you.To be loyal to you.To be open minded to discussing or trying new things.Some things I am looking for in a women are,Kindness and caringAffectionate and like to hold hands and kissIn your closet I would find a cute little black dress with FM pumps along side a of jeans with boots.Must like dogs or a dogOpen and honestAnd not a prudeSo are you interested?

I was raised on TV in the 60s, and I am a TV-phile, so I don't mind spending evenings at home-I think the term is ""cocooning"". But, honestly, I don't watch as much TV as I used to; I like to spend face-to-face time just talking, laughing & sharing thoughts. I do like to go to an occasional happy-hour. I like salsa/cumbia/merengue dancing. I also enjoy dinner, drinks & going to the cinema. I spend my week-ends doing upkeep on my home, and, of course, I like to barbecue on my backyard patio & hang out with friends as well.I like all kinds of music, but lean towards Christian music, although I do also enjoy classic rock (aka ""oldies""), jazz & R&B. My taste in music is quite diverse; it ranges from Jason Gray to Fleetwood Mac to Billy Holiday to Andrea Bocelli. I can handle country music & country dancing, and can tolerate rap music in small doses, as long at it's not misogynistic, hedonistic garbage. As I mentioned above, I do like salsa/cumbia/merengue music & dancing, and really enjoy the tunes of ""El Tule"" & of ""La Guerilla"". I am blessed to be friends with members of both these groups. And when I'm in a relaxing mood, I enjoy the soulful sounds of DB Martin & the DB Martin Group; DB is also a friend, and a great musician.If the most important relationship in your life isn't with God, then I'm probably not the man for you. God is first in my life; He is the love of my life, and I am looking for a mate who feels the same. But, I don't pretend to be perfect, by any means; I'm no saint. I understand that I need Christ in my life because I am a sinner in need of a Savior. I am a loving, kind, caring, sensitive, humorous, open-minded, intelligent, progressive, Christian gentleman who tries to contribute to the betterment of individuals and to society as a whole. I don't pretend to be something I'm not. I am NOT a ""macho"" man; I am secure with who I am. I am who I am. I'm not going to lie & tell you that I'll be someone I'm not, or that I'll do something I that won't, just to get you to ""like"" me. Overall, I just want a nice, healthy, happy, love-filled, drama-free, Christian, God-filled life, and I am looking for a sweet, loving, compatible, Christian woman with whom to share that. Here's the link to my Facebook profile:https://www.facebook.com/thomasserrato?ref=tn_tnmnIt's pretty much my blog. If you like what you see & read, I hope to hear from you. Either way, take care & good luck.

My people have been in that area since about 1870, when my great grandfather immigrated from Croatia(Yugoslavia or ""Austrian Empire"" as stated in his census records!) and settled 1st in the Rockport area. Frandolig Point Park is named after my great grandmother's family. My father owned and operated a place on the waterfront called Woody's Boat Basin, now called Woody's SportsCenter. I grew up on the docks and running around barefoot on oyster shells . I'm the youngest of seven and my closest sibling is 10 years my elder and my eldest sibling was 24 years old when I was born. All but my two youngest sisters have passed, as have both of my parents. Dad died at 95 and mom at 84, so I was blessed to have them both for a long time. I miss them, but I really can't complain. They both passed peacefully and my mother passed in our hundred-year-old home just across the street from where she was born in Port Aransas. You may not be surprised to know that yes, I was spoiled! We were not wealthy, but very comfortable.Much of my life was spent in the Scouting program. I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, traveled America and the world with Scouting, and founded both a Cub Scout Pack and a Boy Scout Troop here in Leander. And No I am NOT happy about openly gay people being allowed to join, but ecstatic about girls finally being given the opportunities given to boys for almost 110 years. Girl Scouts has no clue about what is RIGHT! I have three daughters and one son that range from 14 years old to 23. My oldest daughter attended Abilene Christian University on a choir scholarship and graduated 12/17 and just started her 1st job as the asst. choir director at a high school NW of Houston! YAY!!! Maybe a country singing artist someday! WOO HOO! SHE IS AWESOME! My 21 year old son finished his freshman year at Texas A&M University pursuing a degree in chemical engineering and quite frankly he, let's just say, didn't have his ducks in a row. Still there, but attending Blinn until Aggieland likes him again, and is currently practicing being an adult and paying his own rent and most of his bills!!! My 20 year-old daughter is my newest Aggie and is pursuing a degree in agri-economics and was just accepted as an Aggie Blossom!! The baby is a big 8th grader and plays all 5 sports at school...Vball, bball, cross country, track, and soccer, in addition to playing club volleyball for the Austin Juniors and playing rec softball. Both of my younger daughters played very competitive level softball and are both still in Girl Scouts. The older of the two travelled to France, Italy, and England with Girl Scouts and her mom this summer. As a family, we all hunt and fish. All of my kids have taken deer at our now sold family ranch near Medina, Texas. My 20 year old just took a beautiful 8 point buck 12/17. Sorry if you think that's cruel, but when push comes to shove, we will survive while you crunch on KEENwahhh!(Love me some quinoa btw!) I currently live in an old stone ranch house which I lease on 240 acres on the edge of town with Starbucks about five minutes away. My ex and I are friendly and we have joint custody, although her home is their primary residence about 5 miles away. They come when they want to come or when I want them to come. We don't fight over the kids at all. I have a beautiful yellow Labrador retriever named Nala. She's my buddy, my watchdog, and my hunting companion. I recently rescued a little turdbird Chihuahua named Bo (BoBo!) from a a friend whose circumstances changed and he is basically Nala's new buddy and chew toy!I'm a diehard Astros-WORLD CHAMPS 2017....YAY!, Cowboys, and Spurs fan and at least one is ROCKIN' IT and last I checked, none of them are showing their asses by disrespecting Old Glory, America, or most important of all, our amazing Veterans, which includes all three of my brothers and my AMAZING mom! Yes, Momma wore Army boots in WWII as a WAC! Love me some Dak & Zeke, but I refuse to support the NFL until they get their kneeling BS straightened out! GO SPURS GO, but keep your liberal political mouth shut Popovic!Musically, I am an old trumpet player and all but my oldest are trumpeters also. I enjoy just about any genre, except gangsta rap and most hip-hop. My musical hero is Stevie Ray Vaughn. It wouldn't be uncommon to find me listening to SRV, Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton, U2, R.E.M., the Cure, the Smiths, Rush, the real Van Halen with David Lee Roth, or any type of jazz or even classical.I jokingly consider myself to be the original metrosexual or in my case, a ""METRONECK!"" Redsexual just didn't sound right! Lol! Explain? I'm just as comfortable in a deer blind, as I am shopping for fine clothing at Neimans in my jacked up FORD truck, and my deer blinds are FENG SHUI. Ha! I am a great cook and yes, homemaker and for the 1st time in years I had a garden with tomatoes and peppers and about 14 different herbs. No, not the smokin' kind! Is there anything mobetta than a homegrown tomater????. I drink Coke and never Pepsi and I'm also a Pepper and drive FORDS! Since 1998, I have owned and operated Bathtub Refinishers of Texas. Mostly, I repair construction damaged bathtubs in new multifamily construction projects. Not particularly glamorous but it pays most of my bills! Thanks to my awesome Mom & Dad and Scouting, I can do just about anything or will figure it out one way or another. I don't buy into all the macho tough guy BS, so if rough, tough, tatted up guys that would rather fight than speak in complete sentences are your bag, feel free to swipe left! And although my life may sound absolutely perfect and I may even sound absolutely perfect, I can assure you I'm pretty normal when it comes to life and things. I'm sure I could go on, but I shan't.Hope to hear from you!Scott",Non-Smoker with Athletic body type," Leander, Texas ","57 year old Male, 6' 2"" (188cm), Christian - other",Caucasian,AustinArea51 wants to date but nothing serious.,Some University,Class Clown,Construction Specialty,Woman,Dating,Not Completed,View his chemistry results,Socially,Undecided/Open,Divorced,No,Bald,Blue,Yes,Yes,Over 10 years,Somewhat Ambitious,Dog,Spanish,57,M,Libra

Personal grooming and pleasant mannerism. Financially self-reliant. Definitely not a scammer by any definition and by any standards. Not seeking a SugarMama of any sort. --- These and similar characteristics qualify me to be ONE helluva GOOD CATCH! You can hook-bait or net, and forever hold onto this catch with your TLC.Once past the confusion and awkwardness of the introduction phase, you'll find in me a man who is: Godly/spiritual with no religious hangups and bigotry; Respectful; Responsible; Laid-back yet proactive; Easy to get along with; Mature; Natural; High spirited; Fun loving; Optimistic; Compassionate; Affectionate; Romantic; Playful; Flirtatious; Caressing; Nurturing; Communicative; Drug 'n' disease free; Emotionally stable; Physically fit. And, when the chord is struck fondly and adoringly, you're sure to experience my responses as very warm, very passionate, very fulfilling.SOME OF MY ESSENTIALS FOR A LASTING RELATIONSHIP- Avoiding drama and scamming inclinations.- Being expressive and demonstrative in needing and wanting my partner.- Refraining from being over inquisitive of my partner's past as well as her unpredictable and un-seeable future course of action. And, while staying within the confines of the present, unconditionally bestowing upon her the faith, trust, and commitment, expressively and demonstratively.- Believing that no one is perfect, and thus accepting and embracing my partner as she is.- Avoiding to force alter the value systems that might have gotten ingrained over time in my partner's personality.- Respecting my partner as a free and independent thinker, thereby allowing her a non-intruding comfort zone to move about and breath in.- Believing and understanding that like me, my partner also emotionally and physically needs, desires, and craves caressing, pampering, fondling, cuddling, flirting, exploring, and everything that is sugar and spice.- Being unabashedly expressive of my feelings and affections for and towards my partner, while at the same time generously reciprocating her moves, needs, wishes, and desires.- Besides ever staying positively responsive, taking lead in initiating moves to seek and secure my partner's attention, closeness, and favors.- Having said the above, a similar explicit and demonstrative belief system and understanding on the part my sweet partner is desired and expected, failing which any relationship is bound to collapse as being incomplete, one sided, and undesirable.A FEW MAJOR ROADBLOCKS IN THE WAY TO ANY RELATIONSHIP- Lack of respect for each other.- Lack of mutual responsibility.- Temptations and expectations stemming from scamming dispositions.- Seeking some sort of sugar daddy / sugar mama relationship.

Just wrapped up a small start-up business developing industrial electronics, so now officially retired-retired and ready for some new adventures. Retired naval officer. UT Austin (Master's), Auburn University (Undergrad). Politically conservative (MAGA). Not into astrology, but for those who it might make a difference -- POF got it wrong -- I'm not a Virgo, born on the cusp in September, which puts me on the Libra side (Phew! Glad that's out there).Current interests include family, a little hobby ranching (few acres) and casual jogging, etc. I do like to travel – international and/or RVing. Did most of my international traveling while on business and when in the Navy. About ready to explore the places I missed in a more leisurely fashion. A 40' RV with all the amenities let's me travel in comfort and includes a tow-Jeep for exploring/4-wheeling and a fishing pole for relaxing. Try to get out on the road for a month or 2 in the summer -- beach, the Rockies and places in between. Snorkeling/ deep-sea fishing in Costa Rica isn't that bad either.You can see somewhat of my life's history in the attached photos, as well as where some of my interests are/were.

I may look like a thug, but I've got a Masters Degree and can hold an intelligent conversation. I live by myself, I own my home, I'm confident, funny, attractive, somewhat normal (or at least not abby-normal), easy to talk to, and a really good kisser. :-) I've been told that I look like Brad Pitt,...from a distance, at night, with the appropriate set of beer-goggles on. I don't lie, cheat, or steal, and I have a big heart. Sort of a tattooed teddy bear. :-)What am I looking for?I would like to find a normal, attractive, sweet girl, with a good sense of humor. If your profile reads like this; High maintenance, bad tempered, bipolar, psychotic, who smokes like a chimney, has most of her own teeth and killed her ex with a meat fork, is looking for a red-neck lover to share her double-wide, then we probably won’t be a good match. Also, I really appreciate honesty. Example; I talked to one girl whose profile said “non-smoker”, but on the phone she sounded like a sea pirate, so it was pretty clear that she wasn’t a stranger to the Marlboro man. I’m not really specific on looks. I think many things can make a woman attractive and/or sexy and beauty is both internal and external. But if you’re 20 years older than your pics, have 3 teeth (even if they’re 3 good teeth), a glass eye, or if your friends refer to you as “sasquatch” because of excessive body hair, we probably wouldn’t be a good match.If we meet, I can pretty much guarantee that you will be intrigued, amused, or at the very least, not bored. :-) One other note. I'm not a biker in the sense that I'm into a specific lifestyle. I'm a program manager working for a computer company. I have a Harley, a bass boat, and lots of other toys.

The ne plus ultra, the alpha and the omega when it comes to ""what you see is what you get"". If you see me wearing something other than shorts from mid February to mid November, something is seriously wrong (weather permitting). I like golf and my mountain bike -- in that order. I follow college football and golf the most, but I like NFL and college basketball also. I like to ride the hike and bike trail fives times a week. I would like to do more camping, and love going to Big Bend National Park. I love to eat and like to cook. I am not into trendy bars and clubs that will be closing 18 months from now - to only be replaced by another trendy bar that will be opening down the street - that will be closing 36 months from now. Bottle service? Really? What a joke! I am not into tattoos, Las Vegas, pit bulls, rap music, or smoking. If you are into those things, we are not a fit. It's not that I am close-minded. Many of my friends have tattoos. It's just where I draw the line. Actually, I have VERY broad interests. I don't know how to explain it, but some people love seafood, some people hate seafood. Some people hate seafood because of the way it tastes; some won't eat seafood because they are committed vegans - for any number of reasons. Vegas has zero charm. It has very little soul. Yes, you can see a great show and have a great meal, but I just can't get past the fake Venice canals and the phony NYC ""skyline"". Vegas started losing the cool factor just after the Rat Pack packed it in. If I choose to visit a city - give me a ""real"" city - NYC, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston. I would rather do a 'staycation' in Austin, than go to Vegas. I am the guy that has to stop at all those historical markers on the way to Lubbock. I like doing the NY Times crossword puzzle. Sorry, but I am not a vegan; I am a fifth-generation Texan and there is just too much culture that would have to be thrown out the window if I went strictly vegan. Politics? I have firm beliefs, but we better talk about that later. But I swear, I can distill politics down to one 20-30 word sentence. Ask me. I like the old stuff like Dylan, Neil Young, Los Lobos, Elvis Costello, Booker T, Also: 8 1/2 Souvenirs, John Fahey, Meat Puppets, Chet Baker, Father John Misty, Sweet Spirit, Moving Panoramas, Bright Light Social Hour, Heartless **stards, Max Frost, John Holt, Toots, Augustus Pablo, Justin Hinds, Dennis Brown, Jackie Mittoo, Heptones, Horace Andy.

Wright, Eddie Floyd, Blaze Foley, Van the Man, Gram Parsons, The Feelies, Bob Marley, Bruce, The Gourds, Isley Bros, Shinyribs, Impressions, Fairport Convention, Dale Watson, Two Tons of Steel, Doug Sahm, Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, and other ""real"" C and W artists, and Memphis and Philly Soul, REM, Kings of Leon, Spoon, Neko Case,****Dale, Black Keys, some classical, e.g, Antonin Dvorak's #9 (""New World Symphony""); Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade. Rap music? Well, you have to ask yourself: why are about 80% of rap songs sampled from other songs? That's simple: these rap artists aren't good enough to make up their own *hit!!I am curious about damn near everything. MY IDEAL MATCH: Looks are one thing, but not the only thing.

I was born in Texas and the World was my playground as a Son of a Solider It has been said that a man that finds a wife finds a good thing. Well the Judge told me that there was a recall on the two I married, LOL. I like to believe; I am a Southern Gentleman, and that every Lady should be treated in the same matter a Man treats his Mother .But please do not think I soft, as I am not. I believe the best part of any relations is conversation. As Lao Tzu teaches that if a Speaker speak from the Heart to the one who is listen the is no misunderstanding. As a man of many years, I have made more than my share of mistakes. I like to believe I have learned from them and the Mistakes of others. I enjoy walks in the parks, cooking at home, movies, plays, concerts, long rides on my Bicycle with friend or just my mp3. I judge no one and do not allow others to judge me. I do not live my Life by the standards of society, as this is measured in greed.I am a man who lives his life by a Code which has been hand down from Master to student for 1000s year, The Code of Bushido). Some people believe that my Politeness’ is a sight of weakness. As a former Solider: I know when it is time to fight. Therefore, I pick my battles, but do not get it twisted The Samurai believed that being Polite was handing the Head of their Enemy back to them after they have cut it off, and I can and will. The question is will I be polite. As for playing Games, like many people in this enjoy doing, these days. I to enjoy to play games but that is what my Granddaughter is for. If you try to bring games into my life, then your feeling will get injured.

And here's what I learned: Women choose men, not the other way around.And when I thought about the women in my life I realized something... they chose me! (I thought it was the other way around!)If the men in your life think they chose you, they're wrong....You allowed them to woo you.Would like to find someone willing to go to the Broken Spoke for dance lessons with me. C&W.So I am going to tell you about me and then you can decide if you want to choose me. Fair enough?I was born in Chicago and sometimes you can hear it when I talk. I grew up in Deerfield, IL and in high school I was more interested in sports and girls than studying - but I'm not at all stupid! I did go to college but it was during the Vietnam war and the influence of the hippie trippy movement. so I didn't graduate. I'm amazed that anyone graduated during that turbulent time.Although I play hockey (team captain) and am a Chicago Bears fan, I have another side. I like plays and musicals. I go to see plays at Way Off Broadway, The Hill Country Theater and The Georgetown Palace whenever I can. I love good conversation on just about anything. So although I don't have a degree, I will probably surprise you with how much I know.Do you love to laugh? A sense of humor is so important. I love to laugh and really want to be with someone who is witty and likes to laugh too.Enjoy spontaneous meetings so it would be nice if we lived fairly close.Like dining out, movies, exploring surrounding towns and dancing if chemistry works. I'm actually a really good dancer, but it's weird - I can't dance well with everyone...there has to be that special something.Dirty martinis are a special love of mine. I'm not an alcoholic by any means but I do love them. I'm thinking that heaven is an awesome bar and a bartender who makes the absolute best martinis!!Religion - Please be open minded. I had a first date with a women who actually got up and abruptly left because she determined I didn't believe in God in the same way she did. I am always learning and love conversations about religion and spirituality. I do not regularly attend church.Family - I have an unbelievable granddaughter who is 7yrs old. She lives with my son and daughter in law in the Dallas area. My other son lives in Denver and is living the dream. He has a great job, a woman he loves and does about anything he wants; hiking, skiing, camping, you name it. I have a sister in Round Rock and another in Chicago.I am a movie lover. In fact, I have a hard time finding a movie I haven't seen on Netflix. So yeah, I do sit on the couch and watch TV. So sue me. But if you have something more interesting....I'm all yours.TV shows I watch are Ancient Aliens, Homestead Rescue, Expedition Unknown.Best movies - As Good As It Gets, Ghost TownSo again, you make the choice.

Do you remember actual interaction? We could always find each other in the most unusual places. Anyway, it's 2019, its modern, so here goes..First and foremost, I'm a man not a boy. Like Kevin Costner said in 'Bull Durham' ""After 20 years in the minors, I don't try out."" You know what you’re going to get with a man like me. With that being said, if you're looking for a boy - girl relationship, pass me by. However, if you’re a woman, along with all that term can imply, and you're tired of being in a youthful relationship, feel free to contact me. I listen, learn, love, feel and enjoy all that life can give, and would expect the same from a like-minded partner. I'm easy to please, low maintenance, (though I can still be quite playful) and would like to meet someone of similar qualities, though I'm not above a sincere comment on your beauty and style, as long as it’s returned, every once in a while. Life takes us places, while we were where we were supposed to beIntelligent, educated, somewhat opinionated, always on the funny side of the street. I can be goofy to intense, given the right venue to express myself. High Tech personality, with a fun side that borders on the fringe of society. I can laugh at all that life brings our way, love the things we cannot change, read, converse, and understand, and I'm always faithful to the one I'm with. Though I've had my wild side, ;o. I'm comfortable in my own skin, and very comfortable in any social circumstance. I've met world leaders, and world creepers. I've lived a very diverse life. I've earned and maintain an advanced PhD in life, and if you make it within the circle, the tale is intriguing to say the least. I am an enigma. I'm conservative on some issues, and liberal on others. I think that makes me sane as well.... Born in the year of the Tiger and being a Virgo, I possess many of the qualities of the same (though also understand that its all mental BS). Cursed with intellect, many people can find me hard to decipher, though I fit well in all settings, and all groups. My favorite movie of all time is ""The Razor's Edge"" with Bill Murray, ""Everafter"", ""Dazed and Confused"" (My early life as seen through a camera) and I loved ""Joe Dirt"" as well. Some of my favorite books include “1984”, ""Freakonomics"", and ""The 10k Year Explosion"", “Why Orwell Matters” (anything by Hitchens), and “The Art of War”, though I'm versed in many other tastes as well. No, I’m not a vampire….. Anne Rice rocked the genre for me as a youth, but that was as far as that era went….Though I can participate in any sports activity, my game is darts. I love the competition and math aspect of the game and have competed and taught on the international level. I love movies, reading, swimming, kayaking, relaxing, biking, lazy weekend mornings in bed, and maintain a wide variety of additional interests. I do suffer from Cedar Fever, (and other allergies like dogs and cats, but that can just go f-off, since I can’t live without my animals, breathing can take a back seat…. lol) though it looks like I've found the cure. Oops, spoke to soon. I carry the experience of life, as everyone our age does, though I’ve learned that not everyone can see or deal with it. We've made it this far in life for a reason, to go on until we go no more. So why not do it with a smile? I sometimes skate in Austin with the adult crowd on Tuesday nights. Seems I forgot somewhere down my path, how much fun I used to have, plus I like the exercise. I live my life, and want someone to share my time with. I'll have a drink only on very special occasions, (is wine still considered alcohol?) but don't mind if you do at all. My past makes me highly friendly in a non partaking manner, but again, don't mind either way. I see it this way, we’ll know it’s right once we’ve spent some time together. Let's meet up. The woman I seek is capable of emotions; love, anger, joy and sorrow, or any additions from beyond the afore mentioned. I’m flexible. I'm looking to feel the welling in my being, the breeze across my face as we wind through the hills, or pass the time away watching a meteor shower from out in the country. I want that spark. I can deal with hippies, prom queens, political activists, professionals, parents, loners, flirts, lovers, independents, romantics or social gadflies. Must love animals, I currently house-sit a mediocre (slightly less than great) Dane, a Boxer/lab mix I was told (though she looks remarkably like a miniature Rottie) and a stray orange cat who are all rescues and more than a handful. We're a package deal BTW. No exceptions there.Please have an open mind, and not someone who deals in absolutes, or deal breakers. Our lives in this world encompasses a myriad of facets that all interact within this very big place, and you never know where or what the next big thing will be, or where life will take you. Adventure and fun are not mutually exclusive, and neither is work and sorrow, or the very pleasant aspect of just being. We'd all like to be somewhere else from time to time. I'd just prefer that you spend most of your time in the here & now. If you've read everything I wrote, made it this far and aren't clicking to the next hunky profile, take a chance at meeting a true original, and having a wonderful time on this planet, and let fantasy time be what it is, an excuse for chocolate.Update: I’m going to state a few things here, first off, just because you read this far doesn’t mean that you know me. This is nothing more than a marketing “teaser”. You can’t get the full picture until you meet me, and spend a while walking around in the well-worn moccasins of life. And to that end, I’ll state here where you can find me most weekends 9:45ish – 10:45ish am. I eat my breakfast on the Bastrop bridge overlooking the Colorado river among the Locks of Love, Mystery and Broken Dreams. If you feel adventurous, or have a curious streak within your being, grab your folding chair (or we can sit on the ground, I’m flexible) a bowl of flakes, some milk and berries, or whatever flips your boat, and join me. I don’t bite. We can talk about the weather, or why gummy bears taste the way they do, or bring your own agenda.

If you pass me by because you don't want to take the time to just barely scratch the surface of what I'm about, then thank you...you just made my shiny needle that much more visible!I grew up in Houston, but have lived in the Austin area for the past 30 years. I am honest, hard-working, and a very loving man who's easygoing and loves to have fun. I enjoy traveling (especially somewhere tropical), hiking (I love Colorado in the summer and Big Bend in the early spring and fall), working out, going to the movies, eating out, weekend brunches, going to the gun range, fast roller coasters and amusement parks, hanging out with friends, and just hanging out at home with that special someone. I also have a very strong love for motorcycles and fast cars. I eat clean and workout 5 times a week. It's important to me to stay healthy and fit, and I'm looking for someone who feels the same. I'm 59 but I don't want to look, and I especially don't want to feel like most 59 year old men. I am also a proud veteran of the United States Navy. And on that note, as a veteran and citizen of the greatest country in the world...I absolutely, positively can not stand Donald J. Trump! I think he is a criminal, a racist, a traitor, a disgrace to this country, and an all around disgusting human being! Yeah, I probably should have led with that in my ""Headline"", probably would have saved some of you some time. If I lost you with that comment, sorry... No actually I'm not sorry! OK, so here's where I'm probably going to lose a lot of you. I do watch a little football (usually just the playoffs and the Superbowl), and I do enjoy going to the occasional hockey game in Cedar Park, but I'm definitely not a huge sports fan. I refuse to spend my precious free time sitting in front of a TV all day! I only drink occasionally so I don't really care for the bar scene, but I do enjoy listening to live music. I love my guns and will never turn down a day at the range, but I do not like to hunt and fish. I have nothing against doing that, just not for me. Neither is camping, unless we're talking about a condo, resort, or 5 star hotel with a king size bed, shower and toilet...then I'm all in! I'm not much of a dancer either, but if you're willing to teach me I'm willing to try. I can grill pretty good, but not a very good cook in the kitchen. However, if you need a good sous-chef, I'm your man. Sorry if those last few details are deal breakers, but I thought I'd should put it out there.I'm not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. Like everyone, I've made mistakes in the past, but I feel like I have grown from them. I make a conscious effort to consistently learn and grow everyday, and to give myself the tools I need to always work at being a better version of myself. The past can not be changed, but I will not let the past define my future.If I haven't lost you yet and you're still reading this, then that's perfect because you're the one that this part applies to. There are a lot of attributes I'm looking for in my life partner, but I truly believe there has to be chemistry and a strong physical attraction. I'm looking for a woman with like interests, and one who will expand my horizons! First and foremost, I'm looking for that special someone. Someone who I enjoy being with and who enjoys being with me, and I can be best friends with! I'm looking for that special woman that I can love, spoil, cherish, and adore...and who will want to do the same for me. That woman who puts a smile on my face, and makes my heart skip a beat every time she walks into the room. The one who makes me smile when I first open my eyes in the morning, because she's laying there next to me looking like an angel. That person that I can't stop thinking about when we're apart, and I can't stop loving on when we're together. That special woman whose beauty is not only on the surface, but also runs deep, deep into her soul... and who will light a fire deep into my soul.

I'm not a biker; I drove the chase truck/trailer. Please do not write me if you are a democrat. 1.) My Hobbies--- I have a collection of tools and gadgets like most men I hang out with. I do just about all my own home and car maintenance to get exercise. I enjoy shopping on my smart phone and at contractor supply stores. I canned 36 pints (48 lb) of fruit jam mid August. So good! I also enjoy cooking meats esp grilling T-bone steaks.2.) My Goals---Get rid of everything and move to a newly built state-of-the-art home that is professionally furnished, decorated, and maintained near Georgetown TX. Probably won't happen because I like my old things too much. But if I meet the right woman my goals will adapt to our relationship. I would like and need a companion. We will both be happy.3.) My Taste In Music--- Have collected music of all genre; steel guitar my fav. Not interested in frog dancing but might enjoy taking ballroom dancing classes with a partner. Would like to play in a dance band.4.) Unique--- The period of time I grew up was simple (the greatest generation). We didn't have electricity until I was six.  Mother cooked on a wood stove before that. She had seven kids and I am the youngest. We had a wonderful farm/ranch with good soil. We were self sufficient. Weekend gatherings were at homes of neighbors or relatives and Church picnics in the summer. The churches were the social hub. I was always kept busy (livestock, crops), had good health, good in math, earned an engineering degree from UT Austin. I can relate to just about anyone who is reasonable, except democrats. I am sobered by the fact that every life on this planet has it's own little world and that my little world is no more important than anyone else's and neither is yours. But we are responsible for own little worlds. I am an engineer; not a comedian, banker, lawyer, or doctor. But I am a trustworthy companion and heavy lifter. I was coddled by my family and friends and enjoyed that. In return I will move mountains if they're not too big. We all want attention but there are givers and there are takers.5.) I Wonder--- it is clear that feminists enjoy seeing men suffer to pay for their sins. It's gotten pretty bad. It's not an ""equal"" thing; feminists don't need men and say so. I see traits of feminism in most women I meet and when I do I want to run the other way before I get into trouble !!! But there's a chance a woman who is a fit is on here and will write me !!

Whether in turns out that I am your prince (much too soon to tell), your frog (I work really, really hard to avoid that sobriquet :), or just a non-entity to you, thanks for stopping by because we are all on this crazy, exciting, journey of life together.So let me introduce myself by saying that I truly love my life—there cannot be a luckier man in the world. Just the joy I get from being with my two grown children lets me claim the title of luckiest man. But I also get to sail Galveston Bay, Lake Travis & occasionally the BVI or Med. With a season ski pass to Steamboat now good all over the continent, I look forward to finding all kinds of steep hills to fall down. Being outdoors—whether boating, competing in sand volleyball tournaments, playing tennis, biking or hiking, of just sitting around absorbing the glory of nature all bring a little song to my heart. Though I never find the time to watch TV alone, I read a lot, love music, and the Arts, like to cook (with or for someone), and have been taking dance lessons to improve my limited but enthusiastic skills. But there’s something about travel that really appeals to me especially to foreign lands with people, cultures, foods, art, history and architecture all so different but with so many common threads. I guess I have ventured out of the US maybe 50 times and I am ready to go 50 more. Great health, great friends, & being lucky (mostly) in business all make me amazingly fortunate.One other thing, as the luckiest man in the world, it would be incredibly selfish of me not to share. While I don't do it nearly enough I do take great joy in having supported a range of charities. I am greatly honored (with my ex-wife) to have a classroom named after us at YES Prep, and to be on the Hall of Honor at the Houston Area Women's Center. I have also actively supported Camp for All, The Children's Assessment Center, Poe Elementary, PACE Youth, the Alley Theater (Gold Circle Member), St. John's School, UT, the NAACP, ACT Blue, WWF, et alia.By the way, although I currently living mostly in Austin, I am able to spend as much time as I want in Houston and Steamboat since I have an interest in each place. I will pick one of the three (or someplace else) for my main residence soon (and visit the others).

Having worked in the medical profession in trauma, orthopedics and being a care giver, said experiences has made me realize that what is preached by the media, the marketers and society is not what is most valued in life. Material possessions do not define an individual but compassion, empathy. love for family, friends, and those less fortunate. It is no surprise to anyone that life is fleeting but many view life, their partners, family, friends for granted. My parents were married for over 60 years, never lost that zeal, love for one another. On separate occasions, young couples, unbeknownst to my parents, introduced themselves, spoke of how beautiful the love my parents exhibited with one other and even purchased their meal. It is this love what I seek in a partner, a love that is steadfast and true, no matter what plays before us. By nature, I am a hopeless romantic, an unabashed giver and pleaser to my partner. Possession of a vivid imagination, so many ways to physically sate my partner's physical and emotional needs. A proponent of strong communication and listening skills, which is paramount in a relationship. Firmly believe in the setting aside of pride, and be the first to apologize.

My friends say I am a happy-hearted man. At this stage in life, I'm not concerned with the so-called baggage, because there’s no person at my age without a heartedly filled historical past of trial and accomplishment. The lines on my face are testament. (I’m attributed with more smile lines than sad lines.)For my soulmate: You see, I'm most passionate in searching for my once in a lifetime special relationship. The endurance of life’s give & take has gifted me with tenacity and strength. Tough times do not last; it’s the reaction to such which assimilates into the core fabric of existence; and with it, gifted only one vaporous life to live. And while I have life, I will hold my someone's hand like I will never get another chance. I will kiss like I only have this one perfect moment; and when I look into the eyes of my someone special, I will look at them as if it’s the last time I will ever see them. I will watch over and protect my someone while they sleep; like there's no tomorrow. And I will love my someone special because they are the only one in this world. I take comfort in sharing my one hope will rest in unconditional love. Proving to me the journey is worth the reward and to rest easy with the shared heart of another in total accomplishment.So a little more to share about me. I’m a well to do, clean cut professional. I have a balance between “old-school” traditions and acceptance of the new. Overtime, I've personally applied my own flavor of self-improvement and have learned much. I will never stop growing into more of who I’m intended to be. I have much to share and enjoy with my someone special; overtime in authenticity. The closest loved ones in my life mean the world to me and possess all the qualities I hope to find in my special companion. I believe it foremost to nurture the wonderful people in my life who also practice positivity. I enjoy dedicating my life to those who are transparent and considerate; whom are great communicators, a lively character through demonstration of ethics, loyalty and core values. I want a compliment which possesses HUGE empathy and compassion for others, aspires to but not fixated/addicted at an attempted healthy lifestyle. (No Vegans Please!) I'm looking for a heart flooded with raw honesty and integrity. I am and have been told by others that I’m fiercely loyal to the people I love! With this, it “inspires” me to live life with a passion second to none; time is short; and I don’t waste my time anymore on things that do not matter. So I encourage you to jump if you feel like jumping, run if you feel like running, sing a song and dance to music in your head when there is none, and enjoy that special home-cooked meal, especially the desert, like it's the last one left in the world!To learn more about me... that will require interaction.

I do not speak Spanish. Hey, it's who I am. But I would like to learn it, should the opportunity arise.I moved to Austin in September of 2017. My son moved his family here, so I followed them to Texas. After raising my son, the thought of seeing my two granddaughters (now 11 and 13) grow up made me feel good. It was no fun to only see them once or twice a year, as they lived in Pennsylvania and I lived in Kansas. My plan is to retire right before the oldest one graduates from high school (of course, that could change). I live north of The Arboretum. I am not good at long distance relationships, so I would only like to meet women with 50 miles of Austin. I'm looking for a good friend, one that I'd like to be with all of the time (not that it is necessary, but I just want you to know that would be nice).

Really, I'd just like to share the air in the room with you.I play drums/percussion in concert and symphonic bands. I've been doing this for years! I play here in Austin and in San Antonio (playing at a 4th of July concert with the San Antonio Symphonic Band in Comfort).I am a non-practicing Catholic. Haven't been to Mass since a brothers funeral in January 2015. And I do not get along with cats (something happened when I was a little kid and it still bothers me). And I do not ride motorcycles, and never will. Oh, and if you voted for 45 and still believe he is a great guy, then we would not be a good match. I haven't paid the extra dollars for 'Meet Me'.

Will re-locate to Texas in the next few month.When I meet a woman my hope that we are open to possibility and that there is a spark and chemistry. We can be who we are from the start and build on that. I gravitate to a woman who is independent and physically attractive, not necessarily in a classic sense. I feel timeless and as a result I am open to meeting some one younger,older,shorter,taller,simpler or smarter than I am. I am free of all past ties that might otherwise be or become obstacles to our goal. There are no current or past relationships in the closet. I come into this work with an understanding about who I am. If we meet and start this very worthwhile connection, you will find that I am who I purport to be ...not a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality. You can feel secure that I will respect you are and the life you have made. I love to laugh, smile, romantic, passionate and intense. I can hear opposing view points and take responsibility for my actions. When I am wrong I will admit it, say I am sorry with out minimizing either you or me. I want to share who I am and connect with an independent, strong woman who seeks the same. I enjoy most anything ...I seldom say no and if I have I might say yes on another occasion.I am 72 years old and feel very fit. I feel like I have lived many life times at this point.

Recently going back 6 years I changed hats and took a JOB as a program aid and from time to time supervisor. This at a very large homeless shelter with close to 400 client. Though I had no resume to qualify me, I was hired right away.The experience was both challenging, enriching and saddening.

Looking forward to doing some traveling...Love listening to live music, taking in a movie, enjoying the company and conversation of good friends, college football (Hook em!), wandering about the greenbelts, and camping by a warm fireplace on a cold night is really cool!

That’s fine; to each his own. However, I am looking for a long term relationship.

I am not here for just physical intimacy (one night stands, 'friends with benefits', to be used for your getting revenge on your significant other because he cheated on you, or to be used to reunite you with your husband because you are separated), but rather on here to find friends of substance and character... That being said, I realize that we cannot see things in just black and white, you lose far too many gradients... I am seriously looking for friends... Are you looking to find a FRIEND, first and foremost? Do you have time for a friend? I do...Meeting someone new is like getting a book, not knowing anything about it... You have to hold it, to see it, to read it, give it some thought and attention... Each day of our lives, begins as being likened to the beginning of a chapter, some with possibly just a few intense passages... You learn something about it every time you flip the page. Do you wonder how it will end, Good or Bad, or will it confuse you? You cannot know until you spend enough time with it... Will you like the book? Will you love it? Will you hate it? Will you judge it and give it away before you even finish it?I believe you must be friends before you can consider moving forward, however I am not opposed to furthering a friendship with the right lady, but a lady she must be... If that is too literal, well I will NOT settle again... I really am getting tired of finding those who have hidden agendas on this site... Someday I do want someone will strive with me for a 'Wants me - Desires me - Can't live without me kind of relationship', but I am cautious and weary in the thought of sharing my past because it has been held against me too many times to abuse me emotionally... I don't need anyone to disrupt my insanity, but it is an awful lot of fun at times with the right person... I do just fine, but acknowledge that there is something missing in my life... But lately I find that most days I have nobody to go and have fun with... I am single by choice, not for lack of opportunity... Sometimes I like doing things by myself, I actually do happen to like my own company, all of me... As long as I still have that, I am never bored... I have my volunteer work, my Riverwalk excursions, my movies, my cat who is my babysitter (he needs his own time to himself now and again, LOL)... I pretty much come and go as I please, when I please... I will probably return to college, just keep learning, and am thinking of working towards becoming a volunteer counselor, I have experience in certain categories, LOL...If you have taken the time to read this far, I say ""Thank you kind soul""... I have taken the time to add images to my profile along with captions that accompany those images that are profound at times... And for you whom actually does read another's profile, just in case you did not know, all you have to do is left click on a picture in my profile, and it will expand the photo/image to the full frame of the picture, revealing hidden things, and in doing this, you can also read the captions or music(via YouTube) that I've attached to each one, and hopefully my efforts will have brought just the simplest of smiles to your day (maybe even hope?)... Do you think of others? Are you willing to give of your time to help people you do not even know? I do considerable volunteer work and it would be nice to meet others that are willing to give of their 'free' time to join me in working volunteer events...In conclusion, I confess that my profile is a little bit winded, but all in all, I believe it is a good read, although I am no writer nor poet... Who knows, you can really NEVER have too many friends, and we should always try to remember that our next friend is still a stranger to us right now, and we will never meet them unless we set out to find friends by just, ""putting ourselves out there""... I am not an upgraded paid member, so I cannot see who clicks that they want to 'meet me'... So if there if it turns out that there is an interest on your behalf, take a chance and send a message... I was raised to be a gentleman (""...Momma tried, Momma tried..."", LOL) and have manners, I have some old fashioned values and views, but I would not look down upon a lady who messages me first... Is it that you might be a little bit shy, or has someone hurt you also, and you are cautious? We are all a little bit shy in our own way(s), and we have all had a relationship turn sour... Good luck to all of you in finding whatever it is that you seek here...""There are no strangers here; only friends you haven't yet met."" ~~ William Butler Yeats...***Post Script : I have a cat (or does he have me?) and definitely will not consider getting rid of him...",Non-Smoker with A Few Extra Pounds body type," San antonio, Texas ","56 year old Male, 5' 11"" (180cm), Christian - other",Caucasian,TiredOfGames2448 is actively seeking a relationship.,Associates Degree,Night Owl,Disabled but not Dead,Woman,Long Term,Viewhis relationship needs,View his chemistry results,Socially,Prefer Not To Say,Divorced,No,Mixed Color,Hazel,Yes,All my kids are over 18,Over 3 years,Somewhat Ambitious,Cat,,56,M,Sagittarius

I have a career that gives me many blessings so I don’t need or want your money, just being honest. I’ve been divorced seven years, empty nester, and drama free!! I desire a drama free woman to grow old with. So, if your married or separated, resolve your issues and let the ink dry on your divorce papers before reaching out to me. Also, I am one that will read your entire profile. While your cleavage pics are nice, if your using your boobs to sell yourself, you’re going to loose my attention. Without saying, I first and foremost want to learn who you are and what are the things in life that make your heart go thump, thump, and thump.What do I want out of life. I had a life changing event in 2017 that opened my eyes to life is precious and we need to make the most of it today, for tomorrow is not a guarantee. So I only post pics of my travels to show me enjoying life. And, if you take notice yes I’m posting pics of baseball stadiums. I’m currently doing a stadium tour which means I’m going to all baseball major league stadiums to watch a baseball game. For those that don’t know baseball, that’s 28 different cities in the U.S. (New York and Chicago has two different teams.) Since April of this year, I’ve done 9 so far, 21 more to go. So now is the time to travel at will. Because I was asked this question, I’ll answer it now. No I’m not with a different woman at every city!! If I get involved with a woman here in San Antonio that wishes to share this experience with me all the much better, otherwise I will still go to them alone because lack of companionship will not stop me. It is what it is. Should we become involved, I will also ask that you please have a passport because Caribbean vacations in my book are a must. I make it a point to go to one country each year. Hope I’m not too demanding!! LolWho am I? I desire a monogamous relationship. I will not get involved in a long distance relationship because they’re proven to not work. Plus, I want the ability to get off of work and say hey babe let’s go relieve some stress. So more than 35 miles outside of SA it’s pushing the outer boundary, but I will make considerations if you capture my attention. I believe faithfulness and communication are the foundations to a relationship. I’m not a jealous man because jealousy only says I don’t trust you which erodies faithfulness. I understand my significant other needs her time also, so I have no issues with her doing her thing on occasion. Hey we can meet for breakfast and laugh about the events of the evening. There is so much more to say but I find women don’t read this far because they only shop for eye candy by the pics men post. No wonder so many women are angry when they keep getting catfished!!

Sorry but I do not do all the winks, meets, favorites, and chemistry mumbo-jumbo with just anyone. If you base this on photos mainly and or it is about your fun and entertainment, GO FISH! I am old school. Anyone for free even WITHOUT good English can set up a minimal profile as a DECOY even if they are not active here, ready, willing or able. Sadly, even the paid sites are little different as sites do not change the people on them. Please do not try to ""meet me"" quickly!Decades ago I learned how risky face to face interviews were for making decisions about people without reviewing all objective information first. If you chose not to write similarly to carefully define yourself and what you seek I will not likely move to speak on the phone and meet you. I choose not to argue with you about just making this easy by meeting, texting or phoning either. It is possible to consider SKYPE or Face-Time after you have caught up to all my disclosures. Back at matching again and quite new to San Antonio! Previous experience taught that most were just here cause it makes them feel good to at least think they might be GIFTED a great generous partner! Getting the mail and attention is fun and gratifying too. On POF one can even get away doing it fast, easy and free irresponsibly toward others. SO FEW bother to WRITE MUCH OF A NARRATIVE, ANSWER MAIL nor get involved in TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT. Worse, almost no one will even tolerate nor cooperate with others trying to do it WELL.I will be taking things slow so if you can't be patient you will just punish yourself! I am GENUINE, PATIENT and COMMITTED so if you are the normal JUST fun and entertainment oriented gal GO FISH! Just because I am so focused does not mean I can not be both fun and extremely entertaining and cooperative too.I am recently fully retired with plenty of time for a wonderful partner to work toward building a great life in retirement! A partner is not a convenience to me for fun, to make my life enjoyable or entertain me either. They are far more important and crucial unquestionably than just a servant or sexual surrogate. I do not seek marriage to trap or control.Defining myself: Stable, reliable and dependable physically, mentally, and financially. Love people but know few are truly trustworthy, loyal and reliable. I am a story/joke teller to amuse and entertain others! Modest to a fault, anti-narcissistic, not pretentious not superficial. Caring, careful intense passionate and generous. A bit volatile when upset but cool down very quickly. Do not pout for days. Almost never cold and distant. affectionate and warm. Religious foundation but more spiritual now, overeducated, kinda structured and stiff. Handy, skillful, mechanically gifted and easily attend to much detailed work. Articulate, low maintenance, caring, mature, intelligent, considerate, courteous, well mannered, mostly happy. Communicative, constructive, effective, Honest to a fault. Generous. Not Petty.Prefer dogs to cats and other animals. Love animals but they are a tremendous responsibility daily. Work to keep things simple and manageable. Prefer country dramatically to city. Prefer simple foods to gourmet and exotic cooking. Rather eat healthy mostly at home but not yet on a plant based diet. Not a real good housekeeper or homemaker/nester but I am not messy! A rudimentary basic cook. Intolerant of myself misleading others. Despise those taking advantage of people especially the less fortunate. Insist on being fair to others. Do not tolerate physical violence but I too often get too loud. Tend to be cooperative especially when something is well planned. Not basically adventurous, am easily entertained and tend to not work to find entertainment. I prefer traveling to places where there are family and friends. Avoid cautiously venturing into bad neighborhoods and many foreign countries. Less comfortable in large crowds. Not possessive, demanding nor controlling despite my primary type A personality and some real stubbornness. I am one of the small minority that tends not to fail to have a plan. Seek substance over superficiality and maturity over youth.Decades back when I last dated FEW were NOT overwhelmed with work, family and friends thereby unfit without the time for quality coupling I am in search of that rare lady with plenty of time who is ready to move forward building a high quality life together in retirement. I never date/dated anyone while still dating someone else. Nor do I ever date anyone who is already dating someone.I am looking for a lady I can SHOWER WITH..................Affection! Qualities Sought In that special Partner:I am not looking for a twin but a partner in goals that often gets there differently than I might. Plenty of free time to share! If you keep a neat clean house and cook ""meat and potatoes stuff"" well along with being physically, financially and emotionally stable and reliable, great! If you TREASURE A PARTNER above almost anything, we agree about our most important goal! If that partner truly is to be more important than your job, house, friends and maybe even family then we are close! If you DO NOT withhold the uncomfortable things you would prefer to not disclose, we might be safe together. If you want to set up exercise most days and try to stay as active physically and mentally as possible, very good. If you prefer eating healthy at home, good. If you are NOT afraid of missing out on most of those big social events and crowds, great. If your partner's frequent gentle caring touch and kisses are far more gratifying than gold, jewelry, or even compliments and gifts, we match.

I am attracted to intelligent, joyful, playful, silly and emotionally stable gals with a lot of personality. Am looking for someone possessing very good communication skills. I am currently reading the book, ""The 5 Love Languages.""You are someone truly special. You are known by your friends to be a Godly lady with ministerial gifts for people because you love people, have an understanding heart and seek the Lord for wisdom. You are a gal with an upbeat perspective. There is a possibility you have set yourself aside for a while, rather than be in-and-out of relationships. You are someone who can spot a pearl of great price because you are one.Things I like I like good conversation, nature walks, family talk, playing pool, health food, share cooking ideas, invention idea sharing, family values, dogs, auto maintenance, computer talk, sports talk, good cup of coffee, giving back rubs, handy man work, solitaire and watching some movies or TV. (TV for the most part is boring) I used to enjoy a Padres game a few times a year but this year it is tough. I like the Red Sox, Patriots and Celtics (all Boston sports teams because I am originally from the North East). I am not much into the casinos other than dining. I could watch someone for a while. I like shopping the bargain / clearance stores especially the factory outlets. Mature guy who doubles as Mr Fix-it. The storage shed project is done. More work than I estimated. One photo here is related to a project. Does this happen to you? At the start of a project you are all gungho but the last 10% is a real grind, details.. details.. and more trips to Home Depot & Lowes. I don't consider myself a cook rather I have specialties I do well. I like to make my own BBQ seasoning - lots of Black Pepper etc, I like to slow cook Whole Bean Vegitable Soups (lentil, barley, black eye peas etc...) during the winter months and for the summer a Mediterranean Vinaigrette Salad made with Light cold press Olive Oil, Balsamic Vinegar, Liquid Aminos, Worcestershire Sauce, Fresh Lemon Juice, Mrs. Dash - All Natural no salt Seasoning, Garlic, Red Onions, Green Onions, White Onions, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts, Cilantro, Mushrooms, Vine Ripe Tomatoes, Celery, and Cabbage. (I really should not be sharing such personal information. :))Recently have taken a fancy to cooking with a Cast Iron Griddle on the BBQ.POF's personality tests say I am: Extraverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving.[""Let's make work fun"": Free-spirited, nervy and nonconforming. If the work is not fun, tends to avoid or drop the issue and move on to something different. Very sociable type who enjoys high energy and jovial interaction. Can keep many projects moving at once. Strength is allowing others to be different and work at an individual pace. Good in big, bureaucratic organizations. Can work the system for the good of all involved. ESFP's natural partner is the ISTJ, or ISFJ. ESFP's dominant Extraverted Sensing function is best matched with a personality that is dominated by Introverted Sensing.] However I wonder why two Extraverted Sensing would not be a great match also? Go figure.I smoke cigars, not cheapies but good cigars (Montecristo, Romeo y Julieta, La Gloria, Arturo Fuente etc.) BTW.. smoke from a good cigar is aromatic similar to a pipe. Cigarette smoke is very different.Observations. Some POF intros are one long paragraph. I wonder if people realize the message it sends? To me, ... complicated.

I am not cruel condescending rude hateful mean or any other negative words you can think of no one that's knows me would use any of those words to describe me jeez babbling again sorry ok so that's it I guess best of luck to everyone.

Just saying it gives me goose-bumps thinking about cruising around the neighborhood after midnight, with a flash light and a burlap bag..you know what they say: One man's garbage is my garbage!

Give and take is essential; neither of us should be selfish. Some of what I like:  I'm a one-on-one type of person. I prefer interacting with my partner rather than being involved with a group activity. Some of the things I enjoy are: Having a drink while doing some lite smack talk over a few games of dominoes (win or lose, it's fun to play!); indulging in a game or two of chess if you know how to play (or are willing to learn); maybe even playing some backgammon.

I am here looking for a woman. I don't care if you are white, black, brown or yellow. I just like an even-tempered, slightly crazy woman with a civilized side. Loves physical contact. Has curves, not hills. I work hard to look decent. Some people don't have to do squat to look good. I am envious. Women either like my looks or don't. No 'on the fence' ladies. That's fair. If we contact each other, that is a start. I read a profile that said, ""if you write and I don't answer, it means I was not inspired. I will assume the same if I write to you"". Then we both know what to expect. It's hard to be polite with rejection. It happens. It's the Internet. I have the free membership here. Messages always come in. I got very tired of the 'want to meet' deal. That is just sticking your fingers in the water. Not like the whole bath. Immersion is a good word. I find, on a dating site, the long descriptive terms are never the 'catch' to this venue. If someone is captured by your looks, and you, theirs. Act on it. There is less BS. Chance encounters are what fuels the flames. I am an ex-college athlete, so I stay in shape from the love of exercise and habit. Irreverant. Intelligent and Inquisitive. I aspire to be content, happy and satisfied. Well-traveled, speak one language well and can be rude in a few. I like all music except for rap. If you don't try here, it's like going to the carny ring toss booth. If you don't try to toss a ring around a bottleneck, you have no chance of winning the 'soft' kitty. As far as a further description goes. Please ask. I feel it's just as good to tell a couple of Louisiana jokes. Better entertainment for the read. I will be glad to trade stories and histories. 3 fellows were having a drink. A Texan, an Arkansas man, and a Louisiana Cajun. The Texan asked the question of what was the best invention in the last 50 years. He said, he thought it was the computer, the man from Arkansas said he thought it was a microwave, the Cajun said he thought it was the thermos bottle. His companions said, "" Plauche, what the Hells that about""? Plauche responded, ""how do it know""? Pierre, Sustan, and Guidry used to go fishing in Whiskey Bay. For years they spent many a weekend pulling up fish, drinking and telling lies. One day Guidry said, ""guys, I gotta tell y'all somethin. Pierre and Sustan turned to him and Guidry said. 'Guys I need to let you know I am going to die. His friends were shocked and said ""what the Hell, Guidry, what's up"". Guidry said I got dem der Aids. His friend were aghast. Guidry was a widow but never showed gay tendencies. They asked him how it could be. Guidry hung his head and said after his wife died he got lonely and just fell into it. His friends were despondent. Guidry continued and said the doctor had given him just a few weeks to live. He said I need a favor from you two when I die. ""Sure"", they both agreed. ""anything"". Guidry said ""this getting together and fishing has been the biggest joy in my life. When I die I want my body cremated and you two to come out here and pour my ashes into Whiskey Bay. Sustan and Pierre both agreed. Several weeks later Guidry, sadly passed. The next weekend, after the funeral, Sustan and Pierre took his ashes out on to the water. Pierre went to throw them overboard and Sustan stopped him and said "" Hey Pierre, you gots to say sumthin before you commit him back to the earth"". Pierre said ""You right"" he pondered a thought for a second or two and as he poured the ashes in the murky water he said ""Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust, poor Guidry, if you only liked that P---y, youd still be here wid us"" Amen... One from the UK. A boy is born. Unfortunately, there was only a head. No torso, no arms or legs. But healthy. The parents loved him, no matter what. On his 18th birthday, the father takes him out to a pub for his first pint. The boy takes a sip and WOOOSH. Out pops the torso. The crowd in the pub holler ""take another sip"". Then WOOOSH out pops his arms. The boy then takes a third sip and WOOOSH, outcome his legs. The boy is so excited he runs out of the pub, straight into the street and WHAM he is hit by a truck and dies.

What I really like...fitness...been a physical and food ""health nut"" my entire life. But currently struggling with motivation. A mutual interest in weight training would be huge plus. Remodeling my home. Warmer weather (under 70 is cold for this body)!

What I don't care much about...religion, hunting, fishing, golfing, dancing (except on very festive occasions). What is a preference (but not entirely a deal breaker)...height, weight proportionate to height, longer hair, other Fire Signs and Scorpios, ability to put together back to back intelligent sentences. No or small tattoos. A balanced view of life and a good sense of HUMOR! Honesty is assumed here, and reciprocated. What is a turn-off...cigarette smoking, hard drug use, excessive cell phone usage, gold diggers and drama queens.

Our lifestyle predominately entailed living off the land we lived upon by raising domestic animals, vegetables, and alfalfa for the animals - a lot of physical and routine work. I decided to use my brain instead of my back, as far as my career was concerned. Fortunately I attended college on a basketball scholarship, and acquired both a BS/MS in Environmental Science. For 24 years, I worked within the Occupational Health, Environmental Affairs, and Safety discipline for 5 Fortune 200 companies. Then fortunately in early 2003, I decided to permanently take my wrist watch off (no children to finance through college), let my hair fly freely, and truly enjoy the fortunate freedom of having time on my side to devote to three of my passions ""Traveling-Trekking-Still Imagery"". So I purchased some good quality digital camera equipment, along with some reliable hiking and backpacking gear and have been enjoying our precious and precarious planet ""Yakni"" ever since. The most recent adventure was the summer of 2018 in ICELAND, which was the coldest and rainiest in more than 100 years, which equated to waterfalls and rivers at wonderful extremes. Yes, I enjoy the outdoors for it truly makes me happy and relaxed when out experiencing its educational wonders.

I also have a luv-therapy for chasing the dimpled ball around the links, which I joyously undertake weekly (if around Marble Falls). Also a cooking/eating healthy passion, but I also indulge a smidgeon with the junk/sweets/paka too. And for sure my passion of ""Enjoying my fortunate freedom of TIME on my side"".

I'm a Christian guy who grew up in Chicago but have lived in Texas most of my adult life. My friends tell me that I am outgoing, fun, adventuresome, trustworthy, sincere, organized, witty, spontaneous, and affectionate. I like to travel near and far, camp and hike in the mountains (I love Big Bend, Rocky Mountain National Park, and Glacier National Park), go for long walks, play tennis, snow ski, play golf, watch sports, try new things, be original, have great conversation, laugh, smile, and get to know people. I also like garage-saling and antiquing (Round Top and Warrenton are fun places I enjoy), and especially like watching UT sports in person or on TV. I also like going to a concert or musical. I'm not crazy about ballet, but I'd go if you were interested. I do like adventure and enjoy exploring the world at home here in Austin, the state, the country, and abroad. Love the National Parks and I truly feel it is one of America's best ideas. I've recently been to Tibet and to the base of Mt. Everest, and I also went on a fabulous expedition cruies to Antarctica. For adventure this year, I'm planning on leading a Christian singles trip to Kenya & Tanzania in November. Not much into watching programmed TV except sporting events and newsworthy items, but I do enjoy watching substantive movies like include A Beautiful Mind, Forest Gump, the Chronicles of Narnia, Life is Beautiful, On Golden Pond, and Notebook. I prefer a dinner-date rather than a movie-date as it afford more of an opportunity for conversation, and I also enjoy attending cultural events such as concerts, plays, and musicals. I also like creative dates such as a physical activity or making dinner together. I enjoy cold evenings in front of the fireplace and drinking hot chocolate or hiking in the mountains while staying at a log cabin. I like the changing of the seasons, enjoy the holidays and decorations (I especially like Christmas), and enjoy visiting family and friends, and staying connected.

I was taught well by my conservative German Grandfather to not acquire debt and make your money count when you spend it. He also taught me how to live off the land. I am pretty much a homebody, but in the country on quite a few acres, you never know when it will become adventurous, or what you might see. I have just this year (2011) put a mobile home on my Mom's property in the woods in Comanche, Tx. It is very peaceful there, and I am in the process of moving there now and should be moved by the end of 2019. If you do not like living in the country or the fact that I am tight with my money, there is no reason to keep on reading. I may be tight, but I am not stingy. ""Some girls don't like boys like me, Ahh, but some girls do"". (words from one of my favorite songs, by Sawyer Brown) I was born and raised in Austin. I have been going to the Texas Hill Country since I was born. My mom has a small ranch in the woods between Llano, and Mason, and also some property in Comanche Texas. The place in Llano has been in the family since 1877, cattle is still raised there. I like to look for Indian artifacts on these places, or anywhere I am allowed to. I am a small engine mechanic (mainly lawnmowers) at my home in north central Austin. I used to be a mechanic at the City of Austin, where I used to work on police cars, police motorcycles, fire trucks, ambulances, and anything the city owned at the time. I don't drink, drug, or smoke, and I have no wife, kids, or debts. I go to Gold's Gym. I do not observe holidays with celebration. I do not believe in a deity, it seems if there was an almighty deity he would hand out some brain aneurysms during the horrible shootings happening here, or at least give the shooter a terrible case of the runs so he would feel so uncomfortable he would not follow through, just saying. I would prefer a long term relationship, but am open to the possibility of a no strings attached relationship. I am just a real guy, looking for a real gal. Who I'd like to meet:A down to earth self-sufficient, woman, that isn't too materialistic, with grown or no kids.

match_742,5d89be1b508ace52538d8a63,transpersonal,A Life of Transformative Meaning/Purpose,"['Transpersonal philosophy', 'Transpersonal practice', 'Jnana Yoga']","Many, many years ago I reached a point in life where I needed to answer the question of ""what am I alive for?"" After wrestling with this issue for awhile I came to the conclusion that I could not answer that question until I first answered another one: ""what is humanity alive for?"" Well, the picture kept getting larger until the question of ""what is the universe alive for?,"" became the fundamental question. For someone formally trained in accounting and business, with a very concretely-oriented mind, these sorts of questions were not easy to address, but addressing them and actualizing the answers has been what my life has been about now for more than a quarter of a century.In brief, my answers to the above questions involve aspiring to live a transpersonal life. A transpersonal life is one that is to be spirit-inspired and that serves a function for and as an integral part of the world. Such a life includes an inner mutation and an outer transformation, thereby changing both one's self and the world. The inner mutation involves changing the quality of one's will, thoughts, feelings, desires, emotions, and values. The outer transformation entails changing the quality of one's behavior and activity in the world, therefore also one's relationships with others. Such a mutation and transformation is to be founded upon, infused with, and impelled by an all-inclusive, universal, Divine Love-Compassion.One function of the inner mutation and outer transformation is to redirect one's allegiance from lesser wholes--one's family, people, country, etc.--to the greater planetary whole, that essence within which we live and move, and which IS our being. Another function is to contribute to the preparation of the foundation for a future global society. Such a contribution means to establish a new vision, way of life, and meaning for being; one that is based upon the Earth as the foundation--the Earth, in all of its material, biological, mental, and spiritual aspects.All of which is much easier said than done! (And saying it is not that easy either!) At any rate, following through with my aspiration I could probably be described as a very serious, disciplined, and highly-focused person, with extra helpings of sincerity, honesty, directness, sympathy, and empathy to go along with that!The driving force, the dharma of my life is to work towards and contribute to the establishment, sustentation, dissemination, and exemplification of the vision that infuses and guides the transpersonal way of life. Thus my interests are consonant with and actuated by that vision: transpersonal philosophy and practice (jnana and karma yoga?); personal and planetary transformation; world social, political, ecological/environmental, and spiritual issues and current events. I have formal training in accounting and general business, and psychology and counseling; and informal exposure and interests in many other areas. Among these areas are: spiritual philosophies, metaphysics, theosophy, history, diet and nutrition, etc. The works of Dane Rudhyar, Sri Aurobindo, Helena P. Blavatsky, and Arnold J. Toynbee have had a profound impact upon my development so far.The call and challenge of a pan-human rebirth, transfiguration, and global society is upon us.

There is more to life than just year round weather.I am not really sure where to start as I have not been dating for over 25 years so I will not try to sound like a rambling man.I little about me, I was born in Germany and my family moved here to the states when I was 7. I grow up in a small town at the time called Bakersfield. Now before you go knocking this town it was very different back then, let's remember American graffiti was based on this town. I learned how to hunt, fish, camp and appreciate the simple things in life.After high school I went on to the Air Force and became a pilot before resigning my commission (LtCol) for an early out in 1995 and just 3 years short of retirement. After leaving the Air Force I worked for a large Aerospace company in San Diego as their supply chain manager until 2005 when I started my own business.I have never smoked or tried any drugs and i am also not into the bar/club scene. Got that out of my system early.Some of my interests/hobbies are scuba diving, sport/just for fun shooting, riding Jetskis, building wooden ship models and most recently working with my German Sheppard and starting to enter her in competitions. The photo of me is with one of the Golden's I had, her name is Lucy and she passed away this past February just 3 days before my birthday. Some things of what I have to offer you are simple.I would like to be your best friend, to look out for you and to always have your back and right or wrong, always stand up for you. However if I think your wrong well talk about.To be open and honest with you.To be loyal to you.To be open minded to discussing or trying new things.Some things I am looking for in a women are,Kindness and caringAffectionate and like to hold hands and kissIn your closet I would find a cute little black dress with FM pumps along side a of jeans with boots.Must like dogs or a dogOpen and honestAnd not a prudeSo are you interested?

Having lived in Grand Junction (western) Colorado for 8 years, I grew to really enjoy to hike, bike, downhill ski, horizontal climb & do outdoor things in general. I was raised on TV in the 60s, and I am a TV-phile, so I don't mind spending evenings at home-I think the term is ""cocooning"". But, honestly, I don't watch as much TV as I used to; I like to spend face-to-face time just talking, laughing & sharing thoughts. I do like to go to an occasional happy-hour. I like salsa/cumbia/merengue dancing. I also enjoy dinner, drinks & going to the cinema. I spend my week-ends doing upkeep on my home, and, of course, I like to barbecue on my backyard patio & hang out with friends as well.I like all kinds of music, but lean towards Christian music, although I do also enjoy classic rock (aka ""oldies""), jazz & R&B. My taste in music is quite diverse; it ranges from Jason Gray to Fleetwood Mac to Billy Holiday to Andrea Bocelli. I can handle country music & country dancing, and can tolerate rap music in small doses, as long at it's not misogynistic, hedonistic garbage. As I mentioned above, I do like salsa/cumbia/merengue music & dancing, and really enjoy the tunes of ""El Tule"" & of ""La Guerilla"". I am blessed to be friends with members of both these groups. And when I'm in a relaxing mood, I enjoy the soulful sounds of DB Martin & the DB Martin Group; DB is also a friend, and a great musician.If the most important relationship in your life isn't with God, then I'm probably not the man for you. God is first in my life; He is the love of my life, and I am looking for a mate who feels the same. But, I don't pretend to be perfect, by any means; I'm no saint. I understand that I need Christ in my life because I am a sinner in need of a Savior. I am a loving, kind, caring, sensitive, humorous, open-minded, intelligent, progressive, Christian gentleman who tries to contribute to the betterment of individuals and to society as a whole. I don't pretend to be something I'm not. I am NOT a ""macho"" man; I am secure with who I am. I am who I am. I'm not going to lie & tell you that I'll be someone I'm not, or that I'll do something I that won't, just to get you to ""like"" me. Overall, I just want a nice, healthy, happy, love-filled, drama-free, Christian, God-filled life, and I am looking for a sweet, loving, compatible, Christian woman with whom to share that. Here's the link to my Facebook profile:https://www.facebook.com/thomasserrato?ref=tn_tnmnIt's pretty much my blog. If you like what you see & read, I hope to hear from you.

The truth is, I'm not that interested in myself, what I find interesting is knowledge, and new ideas, experiences, and people. My Kinda Strange people. In fact if you are any kinda strange at all, you are probably my kinda, cuz I like all quirky personalities quite a lot! I wish that ""normal"" people, who are usually just strange people in disguise, would realize that their craziness and unique weirdnesses are their greatest assets! It is for us all to let our weirdness show forth, and make the world, and our relationships and loves, a weirder and more wonderful place for everyone!That said, I think my primary hobby is learning new things. I only came to realize this the other day, that it really is a hobby, and that I collect all of the fascinating things I have learned as a great oeuvre of wonders in my mind! And I like most to take them out and show them to others, so that they may be fascinated by them as I am!I love absolutely all genres of music, film, art of every description but especially modern and avant garde, entertainment, food, and activity. Not every individual piece, but every QUALITY piece. I have a special penchant for bright and mixed colors, and shiny finishes, and upbeat, quirky music, movies, etc. I like to laugh, and to be surprised, and art that is unexpected, and makes me laugh and think at the same time, is the best and most masterful in my eyes.I don't think I need to say too much about what makes me unique, the truth is that we are ALL VERY UNIQUE, and the thing is just to be courageous enough to let our unique qualities shine forth. What I want is for YOU to be courageous enough to just meet me and see my lights, and let me see yours, and we can judge for ourselves. An intelligent person can express themselves well in words on a screen, but how much more wonderful is it to see their smile, their joy, their subtleties and personal qualities in person. Ask me to meet, or I will ask you, and I promise we will enjoy a conversation which will be a self-contained pleasure, even if we are not a match as a couple.

You can occasionally find me having fun with friends at a bar or lounge, dining at a nice restaurant, making random trips to Atlantic City, or enjoying a night staying in watching a good movie. I have great friends and family so my destinations are endless. I do enjoy music very much. I am open minded when it comes to music whether it's classic rock, club music or even 80s. I also enjoy watching Football (Go Pack Go!) and Hockey (Go Red Wings). I'm a Seinfeld advocate as well...The best thing about growing up in New Jersey is going to the shore. Summer or winter, whatever season, doesn't matter because a drive to the beach can make you forget about your problems for a bitI like to stay active by going to the gym and playing sports(hockey, volleyball, golf, etc.). I also do Volunteer work cause I'm a big believer in giving back to the community As I mentioned earlier, I am very easy going. I do not really have a ""type."" I am looking for a nice, honest, All-American girl next door. I feel like now a days people get too consumed with what everyone else has that they lose their sense of self.
